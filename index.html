Ultimately, each of us will become an adult orphan, solely responsible for ourselves for the first time. In <i>Becoming Myself</i>, Dr. Shari Butler shows readers how this profound loss can be a force for growth and positive change, a uniquely liberating opportunity to reevaluate one's life, discover a new sense of completeness��and rediscover talents, desires, and needs that might have been overlooked.</p> <p> Using an approach drawn from studies of the orphaned adult patients from the author's practice, as well as the loss of her own parents, <i>Becoming Myself </i>offers a therapeutic plan that moves beyond grief into using the past in a different way that stimulates maturation, creative energy, and personal power. This insightful program includes innovative exercises to help readers cope with feelings of disconnection, guilt, and sadness, ways to break free from old patterns of being, as well as guidance and encouragement in taking on positive characteristics that might previously have been associated with or "owned" exclusively by the parent.</p></p><p><p></p><b> Who am I now if I am not someone's child? </b><p></p> <p>In this supportive, and healing book, psychotherapist Shari Butler guides you through one of life's most profound, unique, and inevitable losses--the loss of your parents. Dr. Butler shows you how this experience can be far more than a catalyst for feelings of mourning, grief, and even helplessness. This time of crisis can also open you to enormous positive change and growth as you struggle to answer the many issues that will arise, including:</p> <ul> <li>How do I keep my parents close to me as my new life begins? </li><li>Who can I turn for nurturing and other forms of support--and are there ways for me to nurture myself? </li><li>How do I integrate traditions and personality characteristics of my parents into my life now that they're gone? </li><li>What and who will form my identity in the years to come? </li></ul> <p>Through helpful questionnaires, thought-provoking exercises, seasoned advice, and inspiring real-life stories from both her professional and personal experience, Dr. Butler helps you accept the loss of your parents, move through inevitable change, and embrace new beginnings. <i>Becoming Myself </i>will take you from a landscape of grief onto new horizons.</p><p><b>Shari Butler, Ph.D.</b>, is a psychotherapist with more than 20 years of clinical experience. For the past several years, she has been devoted to working with people who have lost their parents.</p></p><h2>Beyond Sovereignty: Territory and Political Economy in the Twenty-First Century</h2><p>Beyond Sovereignty reveals a vision of the future, now unfolding, in which technological developments, especially in areas of electronics and telecommunications, have shifted the balance away from purely territorial political forms to a greater role for non-territorial organizations and identities. The result of this shift that David Elkins foresees is 'government a la carte,' in which there will be greater diversity of governmental forms and a wider range of choice for groups and individuals.<br>Elkins begins with a brief history of ways in which technological changes contributed to the creation of nation-states as we have known them since the seventeenth century. He also considers some of the ways in which political organization in the past has been non-territorial (for example, the Roman Catholic Church). Though nationalism has been part of non-territorial organization throughout most of human history, it has been embodied in territorial states only for three hundred years at most and is now finding expression in political units which cannot be territorial in the way most existing states are, as may be inferred from observing most aboriginal nations and the diaspora of many ethnic groups.<br>Elkins then examines trends which weaken the exclusive and all-purpose nature of the territorial nation-state, such as the globalization of trade, finance, research and development, and marketing, which has created transnational corporations. He then switches his focus to political institutions and instruments of governance, many of which have already been decoupled from their territorial roots. In exploring a non-territorial political future, however, the line between political and social or economic realms has blurred, and thus an inquiry into the state system necessarily leads to a consideration of democracy, community, identity, and postmodern conceptions of individuality, among many other topics.</p><p><p>'The great strength of the book, and one which helps to make it enjoyable reading, is the knack Elkins has for giving concrete examples of how our assumptions can be challenged. Through his historical knowledge he ably demonstrates how relative is the conventional wisdom by which political theory operates.'</p> <p>'This is a stimulating and enlightening treatment of a basic problem deserving of serious study and discussion not only in Canada but in the world at large. Beyond Sovereignty looks beyond sovereign states as the most predatory institutions in the contemporary world.'</p>David J. Elkins is a professor in the Department of Political Science, University of British Columbia.</p><h2>Whitehead&#39;s View of Reality</h2><p>This volume developed out of the felt need of the authors for an introduction to Whitehead&#39;s philosophy which would assist an advanced student ready to tackle &#39;Process and Reality&#39;. Hartshorne presents the historical context in which Whitehead developed his position. Peden provides an explanation of Whitehead&#39;s terminology as it develops in his view of reality.</p><p>Charles Hartshorne was professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago (1928-1955) and was also a member of the University&#39;s Federated Theological Faculty (1943-1955). He then taught at Emory University and later at the University of Texas at Austin. W. Creighton is the Callaway professor emeritus of philosophy at Augusta State University and president emeritus of the Highlands Institute for American Religious and Philosophical Thought.For the many who enjoyed and relied upon this classic collaboration between Charles Hartshorne, one of our most profound philosophers, and Creighton Peden, one of our most insightful narrators of liberal religion, the reappearance of this book (enhanced by a biography of Whitehead and a new bibliography of Hartshorne on Whitehead) will be greeted by cheers. For the newer generation, now participating in the current boom in fresh Whitehead interpretations and applications, it will function as unearthed treasure, available again for many uses. --Frederick Ferr�, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy, University of Georgia, USA<br><br>This expanded version of a long-regarded classic introduction to Whitehead s philosophy by his most reliable interpreters is most welcome. With the inclusion of a brief biography and a carefully chosen bibliography, it will prove most useful to students and general readers interested in knowing more of Whitehead s work, now influential in so many branches of learning, not least theology. --D. W. D. Shaw, OBE, Professor Emeritus of Divinity, University of St Andrews, Scotland</p><h2>Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man</h2><p>The purpose of this work is to present in a single convenient source the current essential information on the disposition of the chemicals and drugs most frequently encountered in episodes of human poisoning. The data included relate to the body fluid concentrations of substances in normal or therapeutic situations, concentrations in fluids and tissues in instances of toxicity and the known metabolic fate of these substances in man. Brief mention is made of specific analytical procedures that are applicable to the determination of each substance and its active metabolites in biological specimens. It is expected that such information will be of particular interest and use to toxicologists, pharmacologists, clinical chemists and clinicians who have need either to conduct an analytical search for these materials in specimens of human origin or to interpret analytical data resulting from such a search.</p><p></p><h2>Catiline, The Monster of Rome: An Ancient Case of Political Assassination</h2><p>Leader of a Conspiracy to Overthrow the Roman Republic, a Reform-Minded Senator Whose Reputation, Life, and Legacy Were Destroyed to Maintain the Status Quo<br> In 62 BC, Roman Senator Lucius Sergius Catiline lay dead on a battlefield in Tuscany. He was slain along with his soldiers after his conspiracy to overthrow the Roman Republic had been exposed by his adversary Cicero. It was an ignominious end for a man described at the time as a perverted, insane monster who had attempted to return his family to fortune and social standing. Chroniclers were not kind to Catiline, and his name over the centuries was synonymous with treachery. Recently, scholars have been reappraising the life and influence of this ancient Roman. In <i>Catiline, The Monster of Rome: An Ancient Case of Political Assassination</i>, economic historian Francis Galassi provides the first book-length account of Catiline in more than a generation.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rome first achieved a status as an empire during Catiline&#x2019;s lifetime. The republic was, however, constantly at war with foreign powers and occasionally its own allies, and the disparity between the wealthy and the poor threatened to destabilize society. Catiline was from an aristocratic but impoverished family and first served as an officer with Cornelius Sulla during that general&#x2019;s purges against Gaius Marius, the supposed champion of the oppressed masses. Catiline&#x2019;s goal was to serve Sulla and then use that as a springboard to public office where he could recover his family&#x2019;s former wealth and honor. However, the senatorial elite became suspicious if not threatened by the upstart Catiline and blocked his ambitions. Catiline was dogged by trumped-up charges, including raping a Vestal virgin and murdering his brother-in-law; he was acquitted each time, but his political life was ruined. With citizens demanding land and agrarian reform, Catiline genuinely embraced their dissatisfaction, and realizing that the elite would stop his attempt to gain status through elections, he organized a conspiracy to take control of Roman government through arms. Once his actions had been made public, many of his supporters and co-conspirators left him; but honoring the course he had chosen, he and his remaining soldiers fought a Roman army to their deaths. Rather than the &#x201c;monster&#x201d; as portrayed by his contemporaries, the author contends that Catiline was compelled to act for the benefit of common Romans to save Rome even if it meant overthrowing the government. As Galassi notes, Catiline&#x2019;s contemporary, the slave Spartacus, has been a symbol of social reform for centuries, but it was actually Catiline, not Spartacus, who attempted to change Rome.</p><p>FRANCIS GALASSI received his PhD in economics and economic history from the University of Toronto. As an economist and consultant he has worked for the European Commission and the International Labour Office and at universities around the world. Currently he is senior economic advisor with the Labour Program in the Ministry of Employment and Human Resources for the Canadian Federal government. He lives with his family in Ottawa.</p><h2>Beauty and the Book: Fine Editions and Cultural Distinction in America (Henry McBride Series in Modernism and Modernity)</h2><p>Beauty and the Book is a cultural history of the craze for fine books which began after WWI and ended with the Depression. Benton begins by describing the massive public demand for fine editions, and the anxieties about class, literacy and culture which this craze reflected. She goes on to tell the stories of a range of publishers (from Bennet Cerf at Random House to owners of small, private presses) who catered to this demand by producing absurdly expensive editions, whose prices were justified both by the materials used (vellum, gold leaf, etc.) and the labor intensive processes by which they were created. Ostensibly, these limited editions were an antidote to the rise of mass literacy, and the consequent decline in literary taste. Unlike cheap romances and magazines, these limited editions (usually of classic works) embodied a pre-industrial ideal of &#34;high&#34; culture. Using fine editions as a jumping off point, Benton highlights the many aspirations and investments that swirl around book reading and book buying. Particularly at time in which the book as physical object is being challenged by new technologies, Beauty and the Book describes an extreme version of the materialistic concerns and attachments that are always one aspect of book buying and reading.</p><p>Megan L. Benton is associate professor of English and director of the Publishing and Printing Arts Program at Pacific Lutheran University.Benton (English/Pacific Lutheran Univ.) explores the clash between cultural purists and preying capitalists in the publishing worlds mad rush to create deluxe editions of distinguished authors during the 1920s and '30s. In this boom of fine editions of literary classics, was the goal of the post-WWI publishing industry to illuminate the darkened masses, to finesse the egos of a wealthy generation of parvenus, or to preserve the art of the word for a self-determined cultural elite? Benton answers this question by interrogating the historical record of the publishing world and the lives of the men and women who directed it in the early years of the 20th century. With witty anecdotes that enliven and sharpen her narrative, the publishing giants of yesteryear come alive, complete with the personality wrinkles which line their character. Firecracker Beatrice Ward, stodgy Porter Garnett (who made his employees work under a depiction of Gods eye), and mercenary Bennett Cerf, among others, participated in an unparalleled publishing phenomenon: the marketing of exquisitely handcrafted books, selling for outrageous sums to customers wealthy enough to afford them. Reacting to the mass industrialization of the world around them, these printers worked to create an artistic form for books that mirrored their delicious content. Noble objectives notwithstanding, filthy lucre never fully disappeared from the purity of the projectthis paradox reaching its height as publishers cashed in on the supposed anti-commercialism of their project to sell more and more titles. Bentons lucid prose exposes this fault line between vision and reality with good humor and rigid research, resulting in the most readable of scholarly tomes. A fine book about fine books, Bentons study will delight bibliophiles with its clever mix of history, anecdote, and analysis. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Lit Guild &amp; Doubleday. Tour.</p><p>Stephen White is a clinical psychologist and the New York Times bestselling author of sixteen novels, including Kill Me and Dry Ice. He lives in Colorado.Boulder psychologist Alan Gregory confronts a hapless family's mismanaged-care nightmare, in White's overstuffed sixth thriller. The toddler of Alan's newly transplanted colleague, John Trent, has been stricken with a rare strain of viral myocarditis for which MedExcel, the family's HMO, refuses the only available treatment as too experimental; meanwhile, his wife, TV news personality Brenda Strait, is being harassed by threats and vandalism. As their daughter Chaney lies dying for lack of funds, Trent wonders how much worse things could get. Here's how much: Brenda's daughter Merritt, 15, tries to kill herself, gets dragged back to life refusing to speak, and turns out to be hiding a handgun and a bloody outfit that tie her to the murder of Dr. Edward Robilio, the founder and chairman of MedExcel. Assigned to Merritt's case, Alan finds crippling new connections among the characters at every turn. His cop friend Sam Purdy is the brother-in-law Brenda's been feuding with for years. Dr. Terence Gusman, who chairs the medical exam review board at MedExcel, is the brother of a woman fatally traumatized by Brenda's hard-nosed reporting. Even Alan's urologist neighbor Adrienne, who's been sleeping with the Trent/Strait's lawyer, thinks she prefers the lawyer's wife. As he rolls like a fifth wheel from one crime scene to the next and struggles to get his mute patient to open up--even after she starts to talk, her shocking, predictable revelations are delayed by a series of shameless ploys--Alan goggles at the unholy network of lovers, codependents, and betrayers. The result is that White (Remote Control, 1997, etc.) loses his initial focus on the indictment of uncaring HMOs; by the time you stumble to the center of this labyrinth, you're amazed that the medical community can lift a finger to help this dysfunctional community. -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He has become virtually dissociated from the history of modern positivism and the most recent debates about it. Gertrud Lenzer maintains that the work of Comte is, for better or for worse, essential to an understanding of the modern period of positivism. This collection provides new access to the work of Comte and gives practitioners of various disciplines the possibility of reassessing concepts that were first introduced <em>in </em>Comte's writings.</p> <p>Today much of the ordinary business of academic disciplines is conducted under the assumption that the realm of science is essentially separate from the realms of politics and science. A close reading of Comte will reveal how deeply such current ideas and theories were originally embedded in a particular political context. One of his central methodological principles was that the theory of society had to be removed from the arena of political practice precisely in order to control that practice by means of these same sciences. It is in Comte's work that the reader will be able to observe how the forces of social and political reaction began to be powerfully organized to combat the critical forces in its own and later eras. <em>Auguste Comte and Positivism </em>will be of importance to the work of philosophers, sociologists, political theorists, and historians.</p></p><p><p><em>Gertrud Lenzer</em> is professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

That was the beginning of a love for geology. Raised in beautiful Montana, he spent many days rockhounding near the Big Horn River. This early interest led him to a lifelong study of the world of geology. Patrick was trained in secular geology, but after becoming a Christian, he began to seriously reevaluate his previous evolutionary beliefs, and became, instead, a young-earth creationist. Today, Patrick conducts geology classes (PreK-12) and seminars in the Seattle area, and speaks at numerous home school and church conventions on geology and our young earth. He also leads a variety of geology field trips every year, including Yellowstone Park, where he helps families discover the Biblical geology of the Park. Patrick is the vision behind Northwest Treasures, a 501(c)3 corporation, devoted to creating excellent geology kits, curricula and education for all ages. To help in this endeavor, Patrick has written several textbooks on geology. In the fall of 2012, he opened the Geology Learning Center, a museum/educational center in the Seattle area.

Has this duck ran out of luck?</p></p><p>Learning to read is a complex process. For beginning readers, a crucial step in the process is learning to associate letters with sounds (eg., the short vowel sound of the letter u). The simple verses and patterns in Lucky Duck combine with a strong story line, memorable characters, and delightful illustrations to ensure that beginning readers will have a successful and enjoyable reading experience. <p>The LET'S READ TOGETHER series helps satisfy a growing demand by parents for books that support the "learning to read" experience that can be shared with their children. Includes a list of the short u words featured in the story and fun activities for parent and child to do together. The read-along cassette encourages independent reading, vocabulary building, and enhances listening skills.</p>My goal in writing the fifteen books that comprise the LET&#39;S READ TOGETHER series was to merge the strengths of two approaches to teaching reading, whole language and phonics. The books combine carefully controlled vocabulary emphasizing the application of specific vowel sounds and their variant patterns-AND-authentic stories that have appealing characters, lively action, engaging plots, opportunities for prediction and decision making, and satisfying resolutions.</p><h2>Art of Ancient Greece: Sculpture, Painting, Architecture</h2><p>Over 200 hundred beautifully reproduced color photographs capture the vibrancy and brilliance of the entire panorama of Greek Art.

Sequel to &#34;The Golden Age.&#34;</p><p>Kenneth Grahame&#39;s unjustly neglected collections of vignettes, reminiscences, and inventions capture the ingenuities of a family of children -- three boys and two girls -- who live magnanimous lives nourished by the secret expeditions and private games they share. Written in the last few years of the 19th century, as Grahame looked back fondly at his own childhood, these sketches of growing up are poised artfully between two states of consciousness -- that of a child protagonist and that of a remembering adult -- and so manage to evoke both the active energies of youth and the nostalgic tenderness of reflection. This book, and a companion volume entitled &#34;The Golden Age,&#34; remain beguiling today. While their language is sophisticated, confident reader of ten and up might easily find themselves caught in the web of story the author weaves; older readers have no excuse not to revel in these marvelous volumes.Kenneth Grahame (1859&#x2013;1932)&nbsp;is most&nbsp;famous for his classic of children's literature,&nbsp;<i>The Wind in the Willows</i>.

But it has also long been one of the core topics of the historically oriented social sciences. The immense stock of knowledge furnished by the history of religion and religious studies, theology, sociology and history has to be introduced into the public conscience today. This can promote greater awareness of the contemporary global religious situation and its links with politics and economics and counter rash syntheses such as the "clash of civilizations". This volume is concerned with the connections between religions and the social world and with the extent, limits, and future of secularization. The first part deals with major religious traditions and their explicit or implicit ideas about the individual, social and political order. The second part gives an overview of the religious situation in important geographical areas. Additional contributions analyze the legal organization of the relationship between state and religion in a global perspective and the role of the natural sciences in the process of secularization. The contributors are internationally renowned scholars like Winfried Brugger, Jos� Casanova, Friedrich Wilhelm Graf, Hans Joas, Hans G. Kippenberg, Gudrun Kr�mer, David Martin, Eckart Otto and Rudolf Wagner.<br></p><p><br><strong>Hans Joas</strong> is Director of the Max Weber Center at the University of Erfurt and Professor of Sociology and Social Thought at the University of Chicago.

The theory of dissonance is here applied to the problem of why partial reward, delay of reward , and effort expenditure during training result in increased resistance to extinction.<br><br>The author contends that a state of impasse exists within learning theory largely because some of its major assumptions stand in apparent opposition to cetain well-established experimental results. The book puts forward a new theory that seems to reconcile these data and assumptions. This new theory can account for data with which other theories have difficulty: it integrates empirical phenomena that have been regarded as unrelated, and it is supported by the results of experiments designed specifically to test its implications. These experiments are fully described in the text.</p><p></p><h2>The Bride of Anguished English: A Bonanza of Bloopers, Blunders, Botches, and Boo-Boos</h2><p><p>Fans of Richard Lederer's Anguished English series will cherish this newest installment of the author's latest chronicle of the gifts and gaffes of our oddball language. From headlines to menus, student papers to politicians' speeches, every embarrassing example is true-and wonderfully funny.</p></p><p>Pun lovers and grammarians rarely tire of the humor found in everyday use and misuse of the English language, and Richard Lederer is happy to provide us with a regular supply of such witticisms. An addition to his "Anguished English" series, <i>The Bride of Anguished English</i> is filled with hilarious language-related goofs. Each chapter focuses on a particular group of mishaps, including classic malapropisms, headlines, menus, kids' homework, poor interpretations of lyrics, and politicians' doublespeak.<p> This is not a good book to read in one sitting; each page is funny enough that you'll wind up with tears and a stomachache if you try to plow through it all at once. From "he's got one of those sight-seeing dogs" to "I don't want to cast asparagus at my opponents," the malapropisms are delightful, and the chapter even includes a short history of Mrs. Malaprop's character, and why she was found to be so entertaining by 18th-century theatergoers. The chapter on song lyrics introduces the word "modegreen," and provides some hilarious examples; would Bowie recognize his classic "Major Tom" by the singing of "clown control to Mao Zedong"? Christmas songs may never be the same, if we start singing them the way kids hear them--although "we three kings of porridge and tar" may well be the hit of the holidays. Headlines like "New Vaccine May Contain Rabbis" and "Uneasy Clam Settles Over Michigan" are not only funny, but reading them will help train your eye to seek out such boo-boos in your own local paper. Perfect for teachers, editors, nitpickers, and the annoying punster who shares your office, this absurd and entertaining book is sure to delight. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><p><b>Richard Lederer</b> is the author of more than two dozen books on language, including the bestselling Anguished English series, and most recently, <i>Sleeping Dogs Don't Lay</i>.

By the author of I&#39;ll Never Be Long Gone.</p><p>As in <i>Mirror Lake</i> and<i> I'll Never Be Long Gone</i>, Greene deals with the theme of paternal loss to striking effect in his third novel, a book as incandescent as it is disturbing. Seventeen-year-old Anthony Lopes, who lives with his mother in the working-class town of Galilee, R.I., has prepared himself for a life at sea, like his late fisherman father before him. Yet one night, he and his best friend decide to rob the house of a wealthy lady, who's recently deceased, and his life goes irreversibly wrong. During the robbery, Anthony is hypnotized by a young woman's silhouette at the top of the stairs and doesn't see her father crouched in the darkness. In the struggle, the man falls from the staircase and is killed. Horrified and filled with remorse, Anthony becomes obsessed with the girl, Hannah Forbes, and begins a tortured, all-consuming odyssey to earn her forgiveness and convince her of his love. This richly detailed novel, its tone gentle but heavy with foreboding, is a powerful tale of chance, love, loss and redemption. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.Anthony didn't mean to kill the man. The 17-year-old didn't even know the house was occupied when he broke in to steal the money his friend Victor had told him about. No sooner has he found the cash and started down the stairs than a light goes on and--looking back from the shadows--he sees a girl about his age and so beautiful that he is transfixed. And that's when the man--her father--comes up behind him; there's a struggle, and the man falls over the railing to his death. Anthony flees, but he can't get the girl out of his mind. Finally he resolves to meet her, and they fall in love. Or so Anthony tells us. But not every narrator is reliable, and the reader soon begins to suspect that something strange is going on. Greene's third novel combines elements of romance and suspense effectively enough to create a readable and swift-paced story of obsession that makes for a diverting but sometimes predictable read. <i>Michael Cart</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In his day, during the second decade of the 1900s, Fatty was more popular than Chaplin; he became the first screen actor to make a million dollars a year. But in 1921 he was accused of the rape and murder of actress Virginia Rappe, whom he encountered at a party in San Francisco and who died a few days later. Though he was eventually acquitted by a unanimous jury, the virulent speculation by the press ultimately destroyed Arbuckle's career for good. Framed for a crime he didn't commit, and demonized by conservative powers that hyped the case as emblematic of all the evils of show business, Fatty Arbuckle was the O.J. Simpson of early Hollywood, the first modern celebrity whose presumed guilt - and alleged innocence - galvanized a nation. </p><p>In <i>I, Fatty</i>, Jerry Stahl, the celebrated author of <i>Permanent Midnight</i>, tells the story from Fatty's own perspective. This is an incisive and sympathetic look into the life of a man whose astonishing rise and fall set the precedent for the scandals that still shake Hollywood today.</p></p><p><p>"Jerry Stahl is the American hipster bard." --James Ellroy</p><p>"Jerry Stahl's work fills the gap in American literature left void since the death of the late, great Terry Southern." --Jim Carroll </p><p>"[Stahl's] brilliantly demented riffs beg to be read-or screamed-aloud." --<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p><b>Jerry Stahl</b> is the author of the bestselling memoir<i> Permanent Midnight</i>, which was made into a movie starring Ben Stiller, and the novels <i>Perv - A Love Story </i>and <i>Plainclothes Naked</i>.

He has also written extensively for film and television. He has one daughter and lives in Los Angeles.</p></p><h2>W. S. Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre</h2><p>W. S. Gilbert was one of the giants of nineteenth-century Victorian theatre. He was already the leading young dramatist of his day when he began his celebrated collaboration with Arthur Sullivan, a partnership that produced the great Savoy Operas--still the most popular light operas in the world--and established him at the pinacle of his craft. Now, in <em>W. S. Gilbert: A Classic Victorian and His Theatre</em>, Jane W. Stedman provides an insightful biography of this major theatrical figure.<br> To write this biography, Stedman has returned to the original sources, has talked or corresponded with survivors of Gilbert's generation who knew him, researched deeply into Victorian publications such as <em>Punch, Athenaeum</em>, and <em>Theatre</em>, and has had access to hitherto unpublished materials. The result is not only the most accurate biography of Gilbert ever written, but also the most finely textured, revealing a Gilbert of more complexity and interest than has emerged before. Stedman covers his entire career, including his early journalism, his writing of the <em>Bab Ballads</em> (which are still in print today), theatrical works such as <em>The Palace of Truth, The Wicked World</em>, and <em>Pygmalion and Galatea</em>, and of course his collaboration with Arthur Sullivan. The author also illuminates Gilbert's private life, including a hitherto undiscovered early romantic attachment, and his life-long work for the social acceptance of the theatre and of theatre people, both on and off the stage.<br> A perfect companion volume to Arthur Jacobs's <em>Arthur Sullivan: A Victorian Musician</em>, this deeply researched, vividly written biography will enthrall all fans of Gilbert and Sullivan and anyone interested in the Victorian theatre.</p><p>Sir William Schwenck Gilbert, the witty librettist of the classic Gilbert and Sullivan operetta partnership, was, says Jane Stedman, &#34;an iconoclast who, paradoxically, was not a revolutionary.&#34; He was still a Victorian gentleman, after all. Stedman makes clear however that his poking of fun at the pomposity and hypocrisy of Victorian Britain laid the groundwork for the social criticism of serious dramatists like George Bernard Shaw. Copiously researched , with access to the D&#39;Oyly Carte family papers (Richard D&#39;Oyly Carte was the impresario who ran the Savoy Theater, working closely with Gilbert and Sullivan) Stedman provides a thorough portrait, and in addition gives expert analysis of his work, both serious and comic.<br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Jane W. Stedman</strong> is Emeritus Professor of English at Roosevelt University, in Chicago. A recognized authority on W. S. Gilbert, she is the author of <em>Gilbert Before Sullivan</em>.<br></p><h2>The Hero&#39;s Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work</h2><p>Contains interviews, lectures, and conversations exploring Campbell&#39;s ideas</p><p>The man behind the myth is lovingly revealed in this collection of interviews with the late Joseph Campbell. Using Campbell's format for the "hero's journey," editor Phil Cousineau organized these interviews so that they reflect Campbell's own chronological life quest. He begins with "The Call to Adventure," in which Campbell speaks to his fascination with Native American myth as a child, and moves through "The Road of Trials" (his years in college and as a young professor at Sarah Lawrence) and the "Meeting with the Goddess" (referring to meeting his wife of 50 years, the modern dancer Jean Erdman). Since most of the book is written in a question and answer format (with a few excerpts from lectures), much of the text is in Campbell's own words. It is a feast for any fan to hear Campbell speak so personally about his own life while also imparting his usual insight and wisdom on every topic he discusses.<p> A few morsels of this feast can be found in the following tidbits: for example, readers may be surprised to discover that Campbell considered his half-mile track races in college to be the "peak" experiences of his life. (Campbell was an esteemed track star at Columbia University in the mid-1920s.) Or that it was the famous Paris-dweller and bookseller Sylvia Beach who helped Campbell understand the meaning behind <i>Ulysses</i> in 1928 and was influential in steering Campbell into the realm of mythology and heroes. Or that Campbell believed that his uncanny ability to relate myths to contemporary life came from teaching female students at Sarah Lawrence. "They always wanted the material to relate to themselves, to life," he explained to interviewer Stuart Brown. "I attribute the popular aspects of my writing to the training I got from these students." Or that <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> inspired numerous artists, including George Lucas of <i>Star Wars</i> fame and Richard Adams, author of <i>Watership Down</i>.</p><p> This is also a generously illustrated book, with numerous photos of Campbell, many of which are shown in their authentic sepia tones. Numerous full-color images of famous artwork and images speak to each mythological theme in the book, such as the "Death of Socrates" (Jacques Louis David, 1787) and the painting of "Sacred and Profane" (Titan, circa 1514). <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Phil Cousineau is the best-selling author of &#39;Soul Moments: Marvelous Stories of Synchronicity - Meaningful Coincidences from a Seemingly Random World&#39; and &#39;Art of Pilgrimage: The Seeker&#39;s Guide to Making Travel Sacred&#39; both published by Conari Press. He is a documentary filmmaker, travel leader, photographer and independent scholar and is sponsored by the Joseph Campbell Foundation to lecture on Campbell&#39;s work worldwide.</p><h2>Larva: A Midsummer Night&#39;s Babel (Spanish Literature Series)</h2><p><p>A striking reassessment of the Don Juan myth. A literary tour de force, this extraordinary novel is told in single-minded pursuit of double meanings, but it is serious play. Larva is a rollicking account of a masquerade party in an abandoned mansion in London. Milalias (disguised as Don Juan) searches for Babelle (as Sleeping Beauty) through a linguistic funhouse of puns and wordplay recalling Joyce's Finnegans Wake. A mock-scholarly commentary reveals the backgrounds of the masked revellers, while Rios' allusive language shows that words too wear masks, hiding an astonishing range of further meanings and implications. Larva revives a Hispanic tradition repressed for centuries by introducing the English tradition of puns, palindromes and acrostics (a word puzzle in which certain letters in each line form a word or words) and establishes Rios as the most accomplished successor (in any language) to Joyce.</p></p><p>Julia?n Ri?os is Spain&#39;s foremost post- modernist writer. After co-authoring two books with Octavio Paz, Ri?os went on to write numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including &#34;Larva, Poundemonium, Loves That Bind&#34;, and &#34;Monstruary&#34;, all of which have been published in English translation. He lives in Paris.<p>"Larva is a great novel of language. This adventure in the Spanish language easily translates into English because the creative urge is the same in both, and because Rios is the most cosmopolitan of contemporary writers."--Carlos Fuentes</p></p><h2>X-Men Phoenix Endsong</h2><p>The mysterious and powerful Phoenix Force is life incarnate, and yet it consumes whole worlds in a moment. Its long history with the X-Men is fraught with tragedy... especially concerning one of the most beloved of their number, Jean Grey. What will happen when the Phoenix returns to Earth in search of the one mortal who could ever contain its power... only to find her dead? <br><br> Collects X-MEN: PHOENIX - ENDSONG #1-5.<br><br></p><p>Before you say, "What, another Dark Phoenix story?"--well, on second thought, you <i>can</i> say that, because <i>Phoenix: Endsong</i> is indeed another Dark Phoenix story, though maybe the best-looking one yet. In Greg Pak's five-part miniseries, Jean Grey returns to once again test the resolve of those who love her if they can destroy her for the good of the universe. Ultimately, the story doesn't amount to much, but few artists draw women as beautiful as Greg Land does, and if your main interest is seeing Jean Grey and Emma Frost looking as gorgeous as they've ever looked, <i>Phoenix: Endsong</i> is worth the price of admission. <i>--David Horiuchi</i></p><h2>Rumpole and the Younger Generation</h2><p>The first-ever Rumpole story, introducing many of the characters and setting the scene for the whole series. In reminiscent mood, Horace Rumpole, barrister, looks back to his successful defence of 16-year-old Jim Timson, member of a large and industrious family of south London.</p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.</p><h2>The Celtic Empire: The First Millennium of Celtic History, 1000BC - AD51</h2><p>European recorded history north of the Alps begins with the Celts. At their height, they stretched over the ancient world from Ireland and Britain to Turkey and Czechoslovakia, from Belgium and Gaul to Spain and Italy. They sacked Rome, invaded Greece, and even attempted to take over the Egypt of the Ptolemy pharaohs. Yet theirs was an empire without an emperor, a civilization that encompassed the continent but had no central government. To tell its history, Ellis matches his storytelling talents with the firsthand and classical accounts of the Celtic empire.</p><p>Peter Berresford Ellis, is regarded as one of the pre-eminent Celtic scholars and has published many books on the subject. He is a Fellow of three Royal Societies in historical and antiquarian fields and the recipient of many awards and honours for his work. He is also, under the pseudonym Peter Tremayne he is the author of the bestselling Sister Fidelma murder mysteries set in Ireland in the 7th Century.&#34;* &#34;Berresford Ellis writes lucidly... a fine book, conveying much research and scholarship. Peter Berresford Ellis has long been recognised as a leading Celtic scholar.&#34; - Irish Post reviewing The Celtic Empire * &#34;Celt and Greek has all the immediacy of ancient story telling, sweeping us on...&#34; - New Statesman reviewing Celt and Greek</p><h2>Speeches of Oliver Cromwell</h2><p>Although Oliver Cromwell was essentially a man of action, he was also very much a man of the word, whether written or spoken, informal or ceremonial. Fortunately many of his speeches have survived, giving the modern reader the opportunity to glimpse how Cromwell grappled with the unique and unprecedented problems of guiding the country following the first and only execution of an English monarch. Ivan Roots has here gathered together those speeches and recorded conversations of Cromwell that chart the course of his career, that throw light on Cromwell the man as well as on Cromwell the politician, and that illuminate the political and constitutional history of the Protectorate. In the speeches there is, still, as Carlyle put it, &#39;more of Oliver than in most of the history books about him&#39;.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

From the quaint curbside filling stations of the 1910s to the novelty designs of the 1920s (when stations were built to resemble English cottages, Greek temples, Dutch windmills, and Spanish missions) to the Bauhaus-inspired stations of the 1930s to today's nationwide chains of brightly lit look-alikes, <i>The Gas Station in America</i> is the definitive book on the subject. Richly illustrated with more than 150 images&#x2015;postcards of gas stations, vintage ads, maps, and other memorabilia&#x2015;this book bears witness to an economic and cultural phenomenon that continues to be a defining part of the American experience.</p></p><p>The most significant features of our landscape are often invisible to us. For example: how often have you wondered about the evolution of the gas station? How many gas stations are there in the U.S.? Are gas stations increasing or decreasing in number? What do Bauhaus and feminism have to do with gas station architecture? <p> Whether or not these questions have kept you awake at night (or been asked of you during job interviews), this delightful hybrid between architectural history, economics, pop-culture studies, and geography will give you unexpected insights into one of the more important components of the American landscape. Illustrated with more than 150 maps, photos, and drawings, and highly recommended.</p>"An exemplary exercise in scholarship . . . The authors' thorough account offers an interesting and wide-ranging history of the development of the forms of the gas station, the reason for their development, and the significance of these structures in the developed landscape."&#x2014;Bruce E.

A royal offering from Muhammad Ali, Ottoman Viceroy of Egypt, to King Charles X, she had already traveled 2,000 miles down the Nile to Alexandria, from where she had sailed across the Mediterranean standing in the hold, her long neck and head protruding through a hole cut in the deck. In the spring of 1827, after wintering in Marseille, she was carefully walked 550 miles to Paris to the delight of thousands of onlookers.</p><p>The viceroy's tribute was politically motivated: He commanded the Turkish forces then fighting the Greeks in their war of independence, and hoped his gift would persuade the French not to intervene against him. But the viceroy and his intentions were quickly forgotten as France fell in love with its "beautiful stranger."<br><i>Zarafa</i> chronicles the full story of this remarkable animal, revealing a kaleidoscope of history, science, and culture that opens an exotic window on the early nineteenth century. From the Enlightenment's blossoming fascination with science to Napoleon's ill-fated invasion of Egypt in 1798&#x2013;from the eminent French naturalist �tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire to Bernardino Drovetti, French consul general in Egypt and tomb robber extraordinaire&#x2013;the era was full of memorable events and characters. Michael Allin deftly weaves them into the story with an appreciation for detail and an uncommon affection.</p><p>The giraffe's strange and wonderful journey linked Africa and Europe in mutual discovery. Although her arrival did not keep the French out of Ali's war, she became an instant celebrity in Paris and over the next eighteen years she fascinated all of Europe. Through Michael Allin's narrative skill, <i>Zarafa</i> stirs the imagination as it provides a new context for the history of a distant age.</p></p><p>Zarafa was a gentle 19th-century giraffe, a simple animal whose life was dictated by the tumultuous times around her. From the African savanna where she was caught and tamed as an infant, Zarafa was shipped down the Nile--along with the meat of her mother and several hundred human slaves--to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. From there she sailed on to France, a gift from Muhammad Ali, the "Renaissance Barbarian" viceroy of Egypt, intended to distract King Charles X while Egyptian forces invaded Greece. As political ploy, it didn't work. But as ambassador from an exotic land, this odd animal captivated the French people for almost two decades, as she lived out her life as part of the royal menagerie. <p> Michael Allin intertwines natural history with a brutal chapter in the history of civilization, augmenting the clarity of both. This story of one docile animal contrasts sharply with those of the human profiteers, warmongers, and interlopers who ultimately decide her fate. But Zarafa's otherworldly charm also helps us to understand the intrigue that led Napoleon to bring not only his troops, but a small army of European intellectuals to study all aspects of Egyptian culture and history, in the invasion that sets up her story. <i>--Lauran Cole Warner</i></p>It was the Age of Enlightenment.<p>And in Paris, a gentle, wide-eyed stranger was all the rage....</p><p>In 1826, a twelve-foot giraffe, captured in the Sudan, shipped down the Nile, carried across the Mediterranean in a ship's hold, was now walking across France. A gift from Muhammed Ali, the most powerful man in Africa, this "beautiful stranger" would become an object of adoration in France. But in this compelling, beautifully rendered book, Michael Allin looks beyond the fairy tale to reveal the complex web of politics, culture, religion, and greed that fueled the phenomenon of the giraffe called Zarafa.</p><p>Opening an exotic window on the early nineteenth century, brilliantly capturing what it is like to see something for the very first time, Zarafa weaves a captivating tale of nations and nature, of colorful scoundrels and dangerous rulers -- and of a remarkable animal that charmed a nation, bribed a leader, and brought two very different worlds together.</p></p><h2>Rethinking the MBA: Business Education at a Crossroads</h2><p>"Business Schools Face Test of Faith."

Reissue.</p><p>In this volume, Thomas Weisser reviews hundreds of Asian cult films, rating them with one to four stars. The book is packed with intriguing data and brimming with its author&#39;s knowledge, enthusiasm, and humor. Although Weisser concentrates mainly on movies from the genre&#39;s most fruitful period, the 1980s and 1990s, he also provides a supplementary guide to the martial arts films of the 1970s. Also included is an index to the films of kung fu fighters who tried to take Bruce Lee&#39;s place after the master&#39;s untimely death in 1973. As Max Allan Collins writes in the book&#39;s introduction, this is &#34;a travel guide to an exotic but surprisingly accessible foreign land, an alternate universe of filmmaking that has the energy, talent, and enthusiasm that Hollywood long ago squandered.&#34;Thomas Weisser has been hooked on Asian cult cinema since 1985, when he happened to see Wolf Devil Woman. Since then, he has viewed countless films in the genre.

While waiting for a Marine battalion to arrive, the colonel met daily with a Japanese commission assigned to assist him. When asked what had happened to American prisoners on the island, the Japanese hatched a story to hide the atrocities that they had committed.<br>In truth, the downed flyers had been captured, executed, and eaten by certain senior Japanese officers. Rixey's suspicion of a cover-up was later substantiated by a group of Americans returning from Japan who had lived on Chichi Jima for generations. It would take five months of gathering testimony to uncover all the details. Thirty war criminals were eventually tried at Guam in 1947, five of whom were hanged.<br>Sorties Into Hell is the story of the investigation, the cover-up, and the last hours of those Americans whose remains were distributed to the cooking galleys of Chichi Jima.

Yet, while countries such as Germany have learned the value of confronting the darker side of their own pasts, Russia has never faced the reality of its troubled history in a meaningful and collective way. In this provocative and highly original book, Catherine Merridale asks Russians difficult questions about how their country's volatile past has affected their everyday lives, their aspirations, their dreams, and their nightmares. <br><br>Based on extensive research including rare imperial archives, Soviet propaganda, memoirs, letters, newspapers, literature, psychiatric studies, and texts, as well as interviews with doctors, priests, social workers, policemen, survivors, gravediggers, and funeral directors, <i>Night of Stone</i> seeks answers to the questions: What is the true impact of violence in the Soviet century? How successfully have the Russians psychologically rewritten their own histories? What rituals have survived the Soviet regime, and what do they tell us of the Russian mentality? Reminiscent of the highly successful <i>The Hour of Our Death</i>, <i>Night of Stone</i> is an emotionally wrenching, eloquent work that will appeal to all readers of Russian and European history as well as anyone interested in the processes of memory.</p><p><b>Catherine Merridale</b> is a senior lecturer in history at the University of Bristol and the author of two books on Russia. She lives in Bristol, England."....Ms Merridale...knows that in Russia, if you really want to understand, you have to listen also to the silences. --<i>The Economist</i><br><br>As someone with a keen amateur interest in Russian history and culture, I was intrigued by this book - and, I admit, daunted; the subject matter is undoubtedly heavy. As the title suggests, Merridale investigates attitudes to death and memory in Russia - but in practice, these topics inevitably mean that the book is essentially about how people have lived their lives in such a troubled country, both in the twentieth century and also before that (although the book probably does focus most of its energy on the Soviet experience). The text is always wonderfully erudite, clearly written, thoughtful and thought-provoking and works both as a sweeping work of history and as a piece of fresh research. Merridale carried out numerous personal interviews with individuals and groups in modern Russia, about their memories of what they have lived through (including the Great Patriotic War a.k.a. the Second World War, the siege of Leningrad, the prison camps, and even the terrible famines of the 1930s and 40s), and gains fascinating but painful insights into the ways in which they had dealt with the deaths of their loved ones and the generally traumatic historical century, throughout much of which life had, often, seemed to be so cheap. This is not an easy subject and to be honest, although the book is brilliantly researched and written, I can't claim that it is in any way uplifting - but it is undoubtedly a very important work and one that should be widely read - as widely, perhaps, as other fine recent works on Russian history which seem to have made it into the mainstream of reading in the UK (e.g. Beevor's Stalingrad). The experience of reading 'Night of Stone' will stay with me for some time, particularly perhaps the images of the people who, in the last decade or so, have visited mass graves outside the cities and in the far north, and improvised their own memorials to the people who disappeared, and may be buried there. Their sadness and lack of knowledge about what happened to their loved ones - grandparents, parents, spouses, friends, siblings - is still shared by millions of people in Russia, because of the way in which the Soviet authorities systematically lied, from Stalinist times onwards, to its citizens about events in the country and the fate of their relatives. In fact, Merridale writes wonderfully well too about the slow thaw of information from the 1980s onwards which has finally given many people truthful information. This rambling review probably illustrates that there is almost too much in the book for this reviewer to adequately summarise. I will say, therefore, simply that it is an essential work of cultural history and would be on my recommended short list of essential reading on Russia. --By Colin C<br><br>This is a book that is painful to read, but what it deals with is far more important than the reader's discomfort. This is a book that deals with Russia's experience of death. But of course, what it deals with is the Russian experience with terror and mass murder. Starting off with the rather depresssing and miserable Tsarist state, Russians descended first into the inferno of the first world war, then into the massacres, famine, diseases and cannibalism of the revolutionary civil war. After a bit of a breather, it would then descend into the brutality and famines of collectivization and famine, then the purges and the Gulag, into the final frozen wastelands of the second world war. The climb up Mount Purgatory has been a slow one, and there is no guarantee that anyone will reach the garden at the top where virtuous pagans can go no further. Merridale brings a number of virtues to this account. First, she has read widely and taken care to read the most recent literature (the separate totals of collectivization, famine, purge and gulag have seven digits, not eight). Moreover she has a fine eye for detail. Some are fascinating, such as the fact that Stalin's son spent his infant years in a special nursery designed to be run on Freudian principles. We read stories of the grotesque shortage of graves in 1919 Leningrad, and the pathetically unsuccessful attempts to build a crematorium to deal with the corpses. As an example of Soviet kitsch, we read of popular (and rather tasteless) suggestions for a pantheon in Stalin's memory. There are the relatively small details of Stalinist cruelty, such as the fact that postwar invalids were swept off the streets in order to encourage a fatuous optimism, or the absence of drugs and anaesthetic to ease the pain of dying cancer patients, or the general contempt for mental patients. There are tales of people living through the famine or the purges apparently unaware of its existence, people who still now believe that the myriads of political prisoners were guilty of something, relatives of prisoners denouncing or abandoning their families. More important, though, is Merridale's subtlety and intelligence. The ambiguity is noted early on ("All sides--Reds, Whites, Greens, anarchists (Blacks), and nationalists-- used terror, including the mass slaughter of vilians, as part of their political and military strategy). Early on, she notes old popular traditions which suggest a somewhat callous attitude towards the death of one's children. Yet other traditions say too much grief harms the escaping soul, that tears might bind its soul to the earth forever. Merridale seeks to challenge the idea that the Russians were simply brutalized. She seeks to suggest a more subtle idea of trauma, an idea which is resisted by much of the postSoviet psychiatric profession and indeed by many of the victims she interviews. One problem, of course, is the problem of collective memory in a society that has not allowed it to remember. She notes that there is some evidence that the victims of the Stalinist famine of 1932-33 in Khazakstan no longer remember it, because their society has changed so much. Many monologues seem to have a scripted character, "often generality, chunks of Solzhenitsyn, rumor, snatches from the Book of Revelation..." When people claim they were always religious, or nationalist or anti-communist one cannot take them at their word. One of the most depressing elements of this book is sickening and consistent sense of ambiguity and responsiblity, the way so many people were both victims and exectutioners. There are few reservations one should make about this book. Merridale does at one point confuse the coronation of Nicholas II with the 300th anniversary of the Romanovs. More important, this is very much a book about Russian suffering. --By pnotley@hotmail.com</p><h2>Ancient Jerusalem revealed</h2><p>HARD TO FIND</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Hebrew</p><h2>White Teeth</h2><p>Zadie Smith&#39;s White Teeth is a classic international bestseller and an unforgettable portrait of London One of the most talked about fictional debuts ever, White Teeth is a funny, generous, big-hearted novel, adored by critics and readers alike. Dealing - among many other things - with friendship, love, war, three cultures and three families over three generations, one brown mouse, and the tricky way the past has of coming back and biting you on the ankle, it is a life-affirming, riotous must-read of a book. &#39;Funny, clever ... and a rollicking good read&#39; Independent &#39;An astonishingly assured d�but, funny and serious ...

A strikingly clever and funny book with a passion for ideas, for language and for the rich tragic-comedy of life&#39; Sunday Telegraph &#39;Do believe the hype&#39; The Times &#39;Relentlessly funny ... idiosyncratic, and deeply felt&#39; Guardian</p><p>Epic in scale and intimate in approach, <i>White Teeth</i> is a formidably ambitious debut. First novelist Zadie Smith takes on race, sex, class, history, and the minefield of gender politics, and such is her wit and inventiveness that these weighty subjects seem effortlessly light. She also has an impressive geographical range, guiding the reader from Jamaica to Turkey to Bangladesh and back again.<p> Still, the book's home base is a scrubby North London borough, where we encounter Smith's unlikely heroes: prevaricating Archie Jones and intemperate Samad Iqbal, who served together in the so-called Buggered Battalion during World War II. In the ensuing decades, both have gone forth and multiplied: Archie marries beautiful, bucktoothed Clara--who's on the run from her Jehovah's Witness mother--and fathers a daughter. Samad marries stroppy Alsana, who gives birth to twin sons. Here is multiculturalism in its most elemental form: "Children with first and last names on a direct collision course. Names that secrete within them mass exodus, cramped boats and planes, cold arrivals, medical checks."</p><p> Big questions demand boldly drawn characters. Zadie Smith's aren't heroic, just real: warm, funny, misguided, and entirely familiar. Reading their conversations is like eavesdropping. Even a simple exchange between Alsana and Clara about their pregnancies has a comical ring of truth: "A woman has to have the private things--a husband needn't be involved in body business, in a lady's... parts." And the men, of course, have their own involvement in bodily functions: </p><blockquote> The deal was this: on January 1, 1980, like a New Year dieter who gives up cheese on the condition that he can have chocolate, Samad gave up masturbation so that he might drink. It was a deal, a business proposition, that he had made with God: Samad being the party of the first part, God being the sleeping partner. And since that day Samad had enjoyed relative spiritual peace and many a frothy Guinness with Archibald Jones; he had even developed the habit of taking his last gulp looking up at the sky like a Christian, thinking: I'm basically a good man. </blockquote> Not all of <i>White Teeth</i> is so amusingly carnal. The mixed blessings of assimilation, for example, are an ongoing torture for Samad as he watches his sons grow up. "They have both lost their way," he grumbles. "Strayed so far from what I had intended for them. No doubt they will both marry white women called Sheila and put me in an early grave." These classic immigrant fears--of dilution and disappearance--are no laughing matter. But in the end, they're exactly what gives <i>White Teeth</i> its lasting power and undeniable bite. <i>--Eithne Farry</i>&#x201c;A preternaturally gifted new writer [with] a voice that&#x2019;s street-smart and learned, sassy and philosophical all at the same time.&#x201d;&#x2013;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Brilliant....

Elizabeth Henry reads this tale in a slow, terse voice and creates the characters with shrill intonation and a panoply of accents. Henry&#39;s characterization of Elly fits her perfectly, making the listener dislike her as much as the townspeople in the story. M.B.K. (c)AudioFile, Portland, MaineThis will be a popular item for light summer listening. Cookson's (The Year of the Virgins, Audio Reviews, LJ 7/94) story, set in the English countryside, follows the disastrous marriage of a young Englishman from its beginnings in the 1920s to a happy, if not traditional, conclusion in the 1940s. The young man, Joe Remington, and his new bride Elaine return to his family home near Felburn. Elly cannot understand why Joe treats the servants as if they are, well, human. When Elly becomes pregnant, much against her wishes, she insists that her sister Betty come to care for her and the household. Betty is as plain as Elly is pretty and as kind as Elly is cruel. Will the good woman, Betty, end up with the good man, Joe, when his wife, who we are none too sorry to see go, is conveniently removed from the picture? Elizabeth Henry gives a fine reading, providing each character with a distinct voice and personality. This isn't profound literature; the plot is somewhat contrived, and the characters don't have much depth, even if the story moves along quite well. Still, Cookson's fans will check this out, and others seeking a light listen will enjoy it, too.

The Spanish court is a nest of intrigue and gossip, where a whiff of impropriety can bring ruin. Hopelessly bound by the rules and restrictions of her position, Sofi yearns only to paint. And yet the young Queen needs Sofi's help in other matters- inexperiences as she is, the Queen not only fails to catch the King's eye, but she fails to give him an heir, both of which are crimes that could result in her banishment.

Believable storytelling and wonderfully descriptive writing make <i>The Creation of Eve</i> a must-read for those who love historical fiction, especially if they also love art." <br> -<i>Newark Star-Ledger</i> <br><br> "An intoxicating tale of love, betrayal and redemption. Cullen tackles the contradictions of the Renaissance and captures the dangerous spirit of the Inquisition while handling these vivid characters with prodigious control. <i>The Creation of Eve</i> is a historical romance that teaches as it touches." <br> -<i>Washington Post</i> <br><br> "<i>The Creation of Eve</i> [is a] lavishly detailed, sparkling re-creation. With this suspenseful, evocative tapestry of Renaissance life, art, and royal skullduggery, Lynn Cullen has made a skillful-and, with any luck, permanent-jump into adult fiction." <br> -<i>Atlanta Journal Constitution</i> <br><br> "Endlessly readable, deeply fascinating, and often stunning." <br> -<i>Open Letters Monthly</i> <br><br> "Lynn Cullen weaves a glittering tapestry in <i>The Creation of Eve</i>, blending themes of art, gender and politics into a provocative novel that feels surprisingly timely."<br> -Bookpage <br><br> "Stunning...Cullen obviously immersed herself in the history of Spain's Golden Age, but she never allows her research to outmuscle the story told by her graceful and intelligent narrator. A swoon-worthy blend of mystery, romance, and history." <br> -<i>Atlanta Magazine</i> <br><br> "The year is 1560; Elizabeth of Valois (1544-68) has just become the third wife of King Felipe of Spain, and the talented female painter Sofonisba Anguissola (1532-1625) has been appointed art instructor to the young queen. In a court filled with all manner of politics, from religious debate to petty jealousies and forbidden love affairs, these two conflicted and often unhappy young women find in each other a much-needed friend and companion. Through the eyes of Sofi, Cullen captivates her readers with the thrill and drama of 16th-century Spain. Hewing closely to historical record, the author fills in enough spaces to make a satisfying story but strategically leaves certain details to the imagination, a trick that has the reader deliciously wishing for just a little bit more. <br> <b>VERDICT</b> Marking a strong adult historical fiction debut for YA author Cullen (<i>I Am Rembrandt's Daughter</i>), this is a good choice for fans of Tracy Chevalier, Sarah Dunant, or Elizabeth Kostova's <i>The Swan Thieves</i>. Highly recommended." <br> -Library Journal <br><br> "<i>The Creation of Eve</i> is above all the gorgeously written, beautifully structured story of Sofonisba Anguissola, an Italian Renaissance painter who happened to be both great and female. She is the staunchly intelligent narrator of Lynn Cullen's complex, meticulously researched portrayal of the Court of Spain in the 1560's, and a true heroine in her own right. This novel is a juicy plum from start to finish." <br> -<b>Kate Christensen, author of <i>The Great man</i> and <i>The Epicure's Lament</i></b> <br><br> "To read <i>The Creation of Eve</i> is to experience that wholly delicious bookish pleasure of total immersion. Sofonisba Anguissola, an Italian painter, is sent to Spain as portraitist to Elisabeth de Valois and there, amid the baroque intricacy of court politics, rivalry, and romantic intrigue, she struggles to carve out her role-and her legacy-as one of the most admired painters of her day. I found this novel about the quest for fulfillment in art and love enormously satisfying and I'm grateful to Cullen for the pleasures of such a splendid read." <br> -<b>Sara Gruen, author of <i>Water for Elephants</i> </b> <br><br> "What a marvelous, rich and compelling novel! Lynn Cullen draws an astonishingly vivid world of a gifted woman artist who has studied with Michelangelo and the young unhappy Queen of Spain whom she serves in that turbulent 16th century court. Each woman suffers for a love she cannot have in a time when women were powerless; drawn further into the young Queen's secrets, the artist will risk everything to help her. Turn and find yourself in the 16th century. I was unable to put the novel down and lived in its world." <br> -<b>Stephanie Cowell, author <i>Marrying Mozart</i> </b> <br><br> "Through the keen eye of a painter trained in observation, we are drawn into the rarefied and restricted life of a queen and a court bristling with intrigue, jealousy, misplaced love, escape and escapade---what could be more tantalizing? With rich visual description, Lynn Cullen secures her place in the tradition of regal historical fiction." <br> -<b>Susan Vreeland, author of <i>Luncheon of the Boating Party</i> and <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i> </b> <br><br> "<i>The Creation of Eve</i> takes readers to a fascinating time--the Renaissance--and introduces us to a remarkable woman, a talented artist neglected by history. Thanks to Lynn Cullen, Sofonisba Anguissola is now unforgettable." <br> -<b>Sharon Kay Penman, author of <i>Devil's Brood</i> </b></p><h2>At the Bottom of the Garden: A Dark History of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Nymphs, and Other Troublesome Things</h2><p><p><b>At the Bottom of the Garden</b> is a history of fairies from the ancient world to the present. Steeped in folklore and fantasy, it is a rich and diverse account of the part that fairies and fairy stories have played in culture and society.</p><p>The pretty pastel world of gauzy-winged things who grant wishes and make dreams come true&#x2014;as brought to you by Disney's fairies flitting across a woodland glade, or Tinkerbell&#x2019;s magic wand&#x2014;is predated by a darker, denser world of gorgons, goblins, and gellos; the ancient antecedents of Shakespeare's mischievous Puck or J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. For, as Diane Purkiss explains in this engrossing history, ancient fairies were born of fear: fear of the dark, of death, and of other great rites of passage, birth and sex. To understand the importance of these early fairies to pre-industrial peoples, we need to recover that sense of dread.</p><p>This book begins with the earliest manifestations of fairies in ancient civilizations of the Mediterranean. The child-killing demons and nymphs of these cultures are the joint ancestors of the medieval fairies of northern Europe, when fairy figures provided a bridge between the secular and the sacred. Fairies abducted babies and virgins, spirited away young men who were seduced by fairy queens and remained suspended in liminal states.</p><p>Tamed by Shakespeare's view of the spirit world, Victorian fairies fluttered across the theater stage and the pages of children's books to reappear a century later as detergent trade marks and alien abductors. In learning about these often strange and mysterious creatures, we learn something about ourselves&#x2014;our fears and our desires.</p></p><p><p>Author of <i>The Witch in History</i>, <b>Diane Purkiss</b> was formerly Professor of English at Exeter University and is now Fellow and Tutor at Keble College, Oxford.</p><p>&#x201c;. . . a scholarly overview of the role that fairies have played in culture from the past to the present.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;Illuminating and enormous fun.&#x201d;<br>-<i>Spectator</i></p><br><br><p>&#x201c;<b>At the Bottom of the Garden</b> is brilliant, always on the move, and bone-chilling.

In this groundbreaking book, master storyteller and respected archaeologist Brian Fagan explains how cutting-edge science can now take us beyond the artifacts into the mystical realm of shamans and spirit mediums, ancestor worship, and ritual sacrifice. From the Nile's black land to the Aztec's world of the Fifth Sun, from Stonehenge to Jericho, Fagan describes how Accelerator Mass Spectrometry, Geographic Information Systems, Computer Automated Design-mapping and other sophisticated scientific methods are helping us to decode the religious and spiritual beliefs of our forebears. This new archaeology of the mind&#x201d; blends a wealth of scientific disciplines from botany, zoology, and geology to neuropsychology, palynology, and nuclear physics. With vivid imagery and a transporting voice, Fagan revolutionizes our understanding of the inner lives of ancient people.</p><p><b>Brian Fagan</b> is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A former Guggenheim Fellow, he has written many internationally acclaimed popular books about archaeology, including <i>The Little Ice Age</i>, <i>Floods, Famines, and Emperors</i>, and <i>The Long Summer</i>. He lives in Santa Barbara, California.The unearthing of cave paintings, stone circles, burial mounds, charnel houses, pyramids and the like poses fundamental questions about the relationships between extinct cultures and their perceived worlds. Archaeologist Fagan (The Rape of the Nile) attempts, with the aid of techniques like Accelerator Mass Spectrometry and Computer Automated Design mapping, to bridge the gap between the tangible and intangible, between the material and the spiritual lives of ancient peoples. Advocating the emerging science of the "archaeology of the mind," he suggests that he and his kind are like "Ahabs pursuing our great white whale" since "our limitations of thought, of understandings, of imagination" will prevent us from ever fully reconstructing from the available evidence the worldviews of long-defunct cultures. Nevertheless, his pilgrimageAfrom Lascaux to Zimbabwe; Jericho to Stonehenge; Knossos to the Pyramids of Giza; Chillicothe, Ohio, to Teothihuacan, MexicoAtakes us on an often gripping first-person tour of the world's past, and his excitement in surveying these areas for himself is almost palpable. But the real focus here is on the scienceAfrom debunking conjectures about Stonehenge to reanimating the ?atalh?y?k Goddess cultAand its invaluable contribution to painstaking reconstructions of the time frames and available materials of various eras. While the detail can be a little numbing, the seeming accuracy is refreshing, given the controversy that surrounds many of the more famous sites. <br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Excellent Effect: The Edna Mahan Story</h2><p>Book by Hawkes, Mary Q.</p><p></p><h2>A Little Book of Eternal Wisdom: To Which is Added the &#39;Parable of the Pilgrim&#39; by Walter Hilton</h2><p>THE LITTLE BOOK OF ETERNAL WISDOM is among the best of the writings of Blessed Henry Suso, a priest of the Order of St. Dominic, who lived a life of wonderful labours and sufferings, and died in the Fourteenth century with a reputation for sanctity which the Church has solemnly confirmed. Gregory XVI. granted to the whole Order of St. Dominic the privilege of celebrating his office, and of offering the Mass yearly in his honour, appointing the Second of March for his festival. The Order of St. Dominic, known in the Church both as the Order of Truth and the Order of Preachers, so rich in pontiffs, martyrs, and confessors, is also illustrious for its theologians, its ascetic writers, its great masters of the spiritual life. Its mystic theologians stand in the first rank of those who have scaled the wondrous heights of sublime perfection. Not only have they stood on the mountain tops of the spiritual life, but they have pointed out, with a clearness surpassed by no other writers, the path of ascent, marking for the unwary its every danger. The wiles of the enemy are exposed; where, when, and how he seeks to accomplish our ruin. Our defence is first outlined, and then given in detail. The source of strength is pointed out, and thus the perilous journey may safely be made.</p><p></p><h2>Evil in Carnations (Flower Shop Mysteries, No. 8)</h2><p><i>What do you do when your best friend and roommate can't relate to your relationship bliss?

Her inquiries resulted in publishable responses from more than two hundred fly fishermen in thirty-eight states. Marbury compiled these responses to form this book, first published in 1892. Favorite Flies went through nine printings by 1896 - a fishing best-seller even by today's standards. With its clear descriptions of nearly 300 flies, accompanied by fascinating - and expert - advice on their use, this definitive compilation sounds as startlingly current today as it did over a century ago.

Its central characters, Herbie and Noon, are a loving but unconventional couple whose marriage remains unconsummated for many years as Noon struggles to repossess her sexuality after a brutal attack in her past. While she seeks salvation in the church, Herbie gains sexual gratification in the arms of a bewitching jazz singer named Ethel, a woman who profoundly affects both Noon's and Herbie's lives when she leaves with them, first, a baby girl and then later, a five-year-old named Liz. <br> When a road planned by the city council threatens to break up this South Philadelphia neighborhood, the community must band together. Unexpectedly, Noon rises up and takes the lead in the opposition, fighting for all she's worth to keep her family and community together. <br> <i>Tumbling</i> is a beautiftilly rendered, poignant story about the ties that bind us and the secrets that keep us apart. With striking lyricism, Diane McKinney-Whetstone keenly guides us through the world of community, family, and the human heart.</p><p><p>Noon and Herbie are deeply in love and living in a tightly knit African American neighborhood in South Philadelphia during the 1940s. But their marriage remains unconsummated because of a horrible incident in Noon's past, so each seeks comfort elsewhere: Noon in the warm acceptance of the neighborhood church; Herbie in the arms of Ethel, a jazz singer. Then one day an infant girl is left on their doorstep, and later Ethel blesses them with her five-year-old niece. Suddenly and unexpectedly a family, Herbie, Noon, and their two girls draw closer&#x2014;until an outside threat reawakens a fire in Noon, causing her to rise up and fight to hold her family and her community together.</p><p>Diane McKinney-Whetstone's <em>Tumbling</em> is a poignant, exquisitely rendered story of the ties that bind us and the secrets that keep us apart.</p>Diane McKinney-Whetstone:<br><br>When I started writing <i>Tumbling</i>, I had not given much thought to the time and place for the <br>setting of the story. Actually, I didn't even know what the story would be. I was only sure of <br>this: that I was approaching a significant birthday, that I'd always nursed a passion for writing <br>fiction, that I was using more energy forestalling my dream of writing a novel than it would <br>take just to sit down and start.<br><br>So I started. I got up at 5:00 every morning and spent two magical hours before it was time to <br>wake my teenage twins and dash off to my day job. I was unprepared for the unleashing that <br>happened--like a bottle of champagne uncorked, descriptions spilled all over the page. I soon <br>realized I was writing about my mother's time--South Philadelphia, 1940s-'50s. I'd grown up <br>with her stories about her clean, safe, close-knit neighborhood complete with her descriptions <br>of the stepscrubbing ritual. It seemed like such a vibrant era-the clubs, the music, the <br>excitement of the end of the war. And even though the era had a tremendous downside of <br>forced segregation for African-Americans, it was also a time of community connectedness. I <br>was also raised in the city, in a close-knit neighborhood, so I was able to draw on my <br>experiences as well.<br><br>Once I pinned down the setting, the characters took over--literally. They did unexpected things <br>on the page, they pulled the story one way, then another. I was losing control of the novel it <br>seemed. For example, I didn't--absolutely did not--want Herbie to run around with Ethel. I <br>liked Herbie too much for that, but the attraction between the two was on the page; it was <br>as if they were saying, "You, author, have no sayso here, just let us be true to our characters." <br>So I did. I began to trust the process of writing. It became okay for the novel to twist and <br>turn in directions I had not planned. I even began to welcome those times because the <br>unplanned actions were emerging as the strongest parts of the story.<br><br>For two years between 5:00 and 7:00 in the morning, I put the rest of my life on hold, my job <br>as a public affairs officer, my children, my husband, my volunteer commitments; I immersed <br>myself in the world of <i>Tumbling</i> instead. I followed the characters; I learned so much, about <br>writing for sure, but also about the big human themes--love and hate, good and evil, and <br>compassion, human nature, myself.

Map. Translated by Sonia Soto.<br></p><p>Spain's Arturo Perez-Reverte continues his string of comfortably old-fashioned, modestly intellectual thrillers with a touching and suspenseful story of faith and duty, set in the timeless and enchanting city of Seville. "In Seville different histories were superimposed and interdependent," he writes, aided by Sonia Soto's seamless translation. "A rosary stringing together time, blood and prayers in different languages beneath a blue sky and wise sun that leveled everything over the centuries. Stone survivors that could still be heard. You just had to forget for a moment the camcorders, postcards, coaches full of tourists and cheeky young girls, and put your ear to the stones and listen." As in his previous surprise bestsellers--<i>The Club Dumas</i> and <i>The Flanders Panel</i>, both available in paperback--Perez-Reverte takes a supposedly cool observer and turns the person into a hot-blooded participant in the action. In <i>The Seville Communion</i> it's Father Lorenzo Quart, who works for an investigative branch of the Vatican that is referred to by an angry, upstaged Archbishop of Seville as "you and your mafiosi in Rome, playing God's police." Father Quart, a very attractive man with prematurely gray hair cropped short, wears expensive suits and has to fight off the women who test his vows of celibacy. His toughest challenge is a breathtaking, titled beauty named Macarena, whose banker husband is at the center of a plot to tear down a historic church.

Gene Smith ran the Library of Congress's Tibetan Text Publication Project of the United States Public Law 480 (PL480) - an effort to salvage and reprint the Tibetan literature that had been collected by the exile community or by members of the Bhotia communities of Sikkim, Bhutan, India, and Nepal.<br><br>Smith wrote prefaces to these reprinted books to help clarify and contextualize the particular Tibetan texts: the prefaces served as rough orientations to a poorly understood body of foreign literature. Originally produced in print quantities of twenty, these prefaces quickly became legendary, and soon photocopied collections were handed from scholar to scholar, achieving an almost cult status.<br><br>These essays are collected here for the first time. The impact of Smith's research on the academic study of Tibetan literature has been tremendous, both for his remarkable ability to synthesize diverse materials into coherent accounts of Tibetan literature, history, and religious thought, and for the exemplary critical scholarship he brought to this field.</p><p>E. Gene Smith was born to a Mormon family in Utah and did his graduate work in Inner Asian Studies at the University of Washington in the early 1960s. He was fortunate to live with and receive teachings from Deshung Rinpoche, the great Tibetan polymath who landed in Seattle in this period. While living in Delhi during his thirty-year career in the Library of Congress, Smith organized the printing of rare Tibetan texts for distribution to U.S. libraries through the United States Public Law 480 program. After postings in Jakarta and Cairo, Gene returned to the U.S. in the late 1990s, where he served as acquisitions editor for Wisdom Publications for three years and founded the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center (TBRC), the world's most comprehensive collection of Tibetan literature, which is being made available electronically at tbrc.org. Smith passed away in 2010.

Virtually all of them are seminal in the fields of Tibetan and Buddhist studies, which deserve the new audience this volume will attract.

Temkin fled Poland for the Soviet Union after its partition in 1939. He was drafted into the Red Army and served initially in a labor battalion, but was soon captured by the Germans. After a harrowing escape, he was rescued by the Red Army, which he joined again. During the next two years he fought in many of the campaigns that helped liberate the Ukraine, Romania, and Hungary from the Nazis. This book is not intended as an overview of the battles, but is confined to one man's observations of the cataclysmic events that would shape the world for the next 50 years. It is not for the faint-hearted, for the author describes in great detail the horrors he witnessed and the hardships he endured. His story is easy to read and is more of an oral history than a memoir. However, Temkin tends to ramble on in places and often the chapters are more stream-of-consciousness than organized narrative. A good addition to Holocaust collections.<br><i>Robert Burnham, R. E. Lee High School, Springfield, VA</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.As an 18-year-old Polish Jew from Lodz, Temkin fled to Soviet-controlled Poland after the Nazi invasion. After the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Temkin was drafted into the Red Army. His memoir traces his experiences as he fought the Nazis across Eastern Europe until the taking of Vienna in April 1945. This is essentially a straightforward recounting of a common soldier's perceptions of one of the most massive and heroic military campaigns in modern history. Temkin's prose is somewhat stilted at times, and he writes with a curious detachment, particularly when he reports on atrocities committed against Jews. It is as if Temkin, whose entire family was wiped out during the Holocaust, is deliberately pulling his punches in the interest of "objectivity." Still, the sheer scope of the violence and horror of war on a gigantic scale comes through clearly in this rather unique and frequently stunning chronicle. <i>Jay Freeman</i></p><h2>Tracks</h2><p>Story of a twenty-seven year old woman who set off to cross the rugged bush of her native Australia, accopanied only by four camels and a dog.

Though the subtitle seems to beg the book's comparison with John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley or William Least Heat-Moon's Blue Highways, Coonts's gee-whiz tone soon places his book into a kind of upbeat appreciation of America rather than into a dour, midlife odyssey. You'll recall that Steinbeck was at the end of a long, somewhat soured career, while Heat-Moon had lost in love and seemed to be at the end of his career. Coonts, however, is divorced but riding a crest of popularity, and to pursue his chief passion, old airplanes, with the book already bankrolled is a wonderful lark. Even to include his 14-year-old son, David, on part of the journey seems calculated, although the father-son takes are appealing, particularly when David, high above the earth, folds his arms and announces, ``I'm bored.'' Coonts makes pilgrimages to such shopworn shrines as Disneyland, Hannibal, and even Mt. Rushmore, but he hasn't here much fresh to say about them; he's just a tourist. On the other hand, the culture of the private plane comes delightfully to life as Coonts marvels at a country where every little town has its strip, its laconic air controller, its cheap, clean motel just down the road. His observations on world politics seem pedestrian, but his insight into general aviation is clear and noteworthy: ``The general aviation industry is dying. Federal regulation and the legal system have driven it to the lip of the grave where it is waiting to expire and fall in.'' Middle-class, upbeat to a fault, and unmeditative. Yet the descriptions of flight and the portrait of an America seemingly trapped in a time-warp are arresting. (Eight page photo-insert--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Coonts ( Flight of the Intruder ), in this departure from fiction, describes how he spent the summer of 1991 flying a 50-year-old wood-and-canvas open-cockpit biplane over the contiguous United States. This experience was the fulfillment of a dream for the author, who communicates his love of aviation and adventure in a warm, chatty style that will delight both his fans and aviation aficionados. Although he spent the first two weeks flying with his 14-year-old son, for the rest of the trip Coonts flew solo, feeling joy and facing ? 'experience' used above; also, 'experienced' is especially clumsy as verb, i think danger in Cannibal Queen as the plane hit bad weather, forcing him to tap every one of his considerable piloting skills.

Moore chronicled the adventures of Strong--a physical and mental paragon who defends Millennium City with the help of his wife, Dahlua, their spunky daughter, Tesla, and their talking ape companion, King Solomon--for five years before laying down scripting duties. As the stories collected here demonstrate, his successors have done him proud by deftly combining clever concepts and breezy fun. Schultz has Strong encounter extraterrestrial beings threatening to halt machine-powered flight on Earth, and Brian K. Vaughan focuses on Pneuman, Strong's robot manservant. But the standout story is by Ed Brubaker, who traps Strong in an alternate reality in which he's an ordinary schlemiel who only dreams that he's a superpowered hero. That story's artist, Duncan Fegredo, breaks away from the clean, modernistic approach of the series'original illustrator, Chris Sprouse, into a gritty, slightly messy style that effectively conveys the harsh reality in which Strong finds himself. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

STIG OF THE DUMP is 50 years old and the story of Barney and his best friend, cave-man Stig, is as fresh today as it was when first published. Barney is a solitary little boy, given to wandering off by himself. One day he is lying on the edge of a disused chalk-pit when it gives way and he lands in a sort of cave. Here he meets &#39;somebody with a lot of shaggy hair and two bright black eyes&#39; wearing a rabbit skin and speaking in grunts. He names him Stig. Of course nobody believes Barney when he tells his family all about Stig, but for Barney cave-man Stig is totally real. They become great friends, learning each others ways and embarking on a series of unforgettable adventures. This book is a wonderful Puffin Modern Classic. Clive King was born in Richmond, Surrey, in 1924. When he was young his family moved to a village called Ash, near Sevenoaks in Kent, which is the setting for Stig of the Dump.

It began life as the quintessential working-class movement of affluent Britain -- the conspicuous consumption of clothes, records and drugs were an assertion of individuality and an expression of discontent with the snobbery and prudery of British life.

And finally, Weight examines Mod's relationship hippie escapism, punk iconoclasm and eventually the politics of the far-right, as the cultural nationalism that Mod had spawned took on a more sinister form. As a result, Mods were condemned by moralists of the left and right alike.<br><br>Several decades on from the original Mod generation, today's fashion and music industries still pay tribute to those early days.

Alice, meanwhile, slides between varying levels of consciousness, recalling her past and a love affair that recently ended.

Ultimately, however, these elements merge into a coherent and moving portrait of a young woman's journey toward a life-threatening crisis. In London, one cold day in late fall, Alice Raikes impulsively boards a train home to Scotland. Shortly after joining her two sisters in the Edinburgh train station, she sees something "odd and unexpected and sickening" in the station's restroom that causes her immediately to flee back to London. Later that evening, while walking to the grocery store, Alice broods over what she has seen, then abruptly steps into oncoming traffic. As she lies comatose in her hospital bed, a swirl of voices and images gradually reveals her past--her parents, especially her mother, Ann; her beloved grandmother, Elspeth; her two sisters, so unlike her, both physically and temperamentally; and John Friedman, whom she loved and lost--and hints at her precarious future. The unnamed spectacle of the opening washroom scene resurfaces in Alice's semiconscious haze, and its eventual elucidation comes as less of a shock than a confirmation of all we have learned about her tumultuous existence. Sharply observed details of everyday life and language, original and telling figures of speech and deftly handled plot twists reach a moving climax, while subtly raising the question of whether the objects of Alice's affection--and the sources of her agony--were worth enduring.

Essays. This book is a chronicle of the overlooked and unsung, a collection of award-winning essays based on Brian Jabas Smith&#39;s popular column, &#34;Tucson Salvage.&#34;</p><p>Brian Jabas Smith is an award-winning journalist, editor and the author of SPENT SAINTS &amp; OTHER STORIES and TUCSON SALVAGE: TALES AND RECOLLECTIONS FROM LA FRONTERA. He was a songwriter who fronted bands Beat Angels and Gentlemen AfterDark and at one point he overcame crystal meth and alcohol addictions. As a kid growing up in Tucson, Arizona, Smith was a national class bicycle racer. He lives in Tucson with his wife and young son."In TUCSON SALVAGE, Brian Jabas Smith deftly delivers us a nuanced collection of field reports from the modern human condition; keenly observed, humanely considered, and unquestionably lived."&#x2014;Jonathan Evison, author of <em>All About Lulu, The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving, West of Here</em>, and <em>Lawn Boy</em><br><br>"A true champion of the dispossessed and forgotten. ... I can't recommend this book highly enough."--Willy Vlautin<br><br>"These aren't stories of the movers and shakers of our world, these are stories about the rest of us, the lucky ones trying to hold it together under the daily grind and the not so lucky who have been crushed by all the moving and shaking. Brian Jabas Smith lovingly describes these people, their remarkable spirit and resilience and the city and desert they call home. Thank God or whatever deity may be out there that we have gifted writers like Brian Jabas Smith who have chosen to undertake the noble endeavor of telling these stories, and to remind us that these human beings who exist in the shadows are as much us as those who live in the limelight."&#x2014;Tom Hansen, author of <em>American Junkie</em> and <em>This is What We Do</em><br><br>"TUCSON SALVAGE is holy work, no doubt about it, but done by a fallen altar boy who truly knows what it's like to feel completely alone and abandoned, all bridges burned, no direction home."&#x2014;Dan Stuart, singer-songwriter, and author of <em>The Deliverance of Marlowe Billings: A False Memoir</em> and <em>The Unfortunate Demise of Marlow Billings</em><br><br>"A humble troubadour of Tucson's desert-fried streets and dives, Brian Jabas Smith listens to barmaids and junkies, to the homeless and the undocumented, and retells their heartbreak tales in incandescent prose.

In the second part of the book Jaki argues that Christian monotheism alone provides the intellectual safeguards for a valid cosmological argument, restores the sense of purpose destroyed by theories of evolution, and secures firm ethical guidelines against fearful abuses of scientific know-how.</p></p><p></p><h2>A History of Arctic Exploration: Discovery, Adventure and Endurance at the Top of the World</h2><p><p>As global warming melts polar ice and opens northern seaways, a book on Arctic exploration couldn&#x2019;t be timelier.

Along with familiar explorers, including Captain Cook, Amundsen, and Byrd, it introduces readers to the men behind the names on the map, such as Barents and Bering, as well as unfamiliar but equally important navigators, such as Franklin, Cheluskin, and Nordenskiold.</p></p><p><p>Juha Nurminen, is Head of the Nurminen Foundation in Helsinki, Finland.</p><p>Matti Lainema has travelled in Arctic regions, and collects literature concerning expeditions.</p></p><h2>No More Prisons</h2><p>Winner of the 2000 Firecracker Alternative Book Award for Best Book, Politics.</p><p>Text: EnglishFollowing the successful release of his first self-published book (Bomb the Suburbs), Wimsatt finds more issues to rant about in his latest collection of essays, some of which have appeared in such publications as the Utne Reader and the New Haven Advocate. In some of his most lucid writing, the self-proclaimed "cool rich kid" takes on the American penal system and its emphasis on punishment at the expense of hope and rehabilitation. However, much of that section's impact is lost when Wimsatt suddenly turns guru: "For every road and zoo and gated community and fence and lock and alarm system and prison we build, we are installing another prison cell in our hearts." In "Homeschooling and Self-Education," he tries for the anarchistic, mocking tone that yippies Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman made famous in the late 1960s, charging that American education fosters a host of maladies, including passivity, dullness, eating disorders and self-hatred. His scorn for white class privilege, greed and the "sterility" of suburbia surfaces in several of his more challenging short pieces, notably in an informative interview with David Rusk, the former mayor of Albuquerque, N. Mex. The interviews with various activists and politicos that dot the book are often more thought-provoking than the pat sarcasm in Wimsatt's tirades against the enemies of hip-hop and socially responsible philanthropy. Irreverent, occasionally hilarious, but distracting in its obsession with the artistic shortcomings of his previous book, Wimsatt's new work offers a strange, affecting glimpse into the head of a Gen-X cultural maverick.

Coil discusses a wide variety of common toxic plants, including those of the garden, house, and the wild. A particularly interesting chapter discusses how many of our common fruits and vegetables, such as rhubarb and lima beans, can be dangerous to eat if not prepared or cooked properly. The final chapter lists common-sense rules regarding the prevention of accidental poisoning. Throughout the book, each written description of a particular plant is accompanied by a watercolor sketch to aid in identification. Carol Lerner's Moonseed and Mistletoe: A Book of Poisonous Plants (Morrow, 1988) is also a fine introduction to this topic, although it contains fewer species. Picture Guide uses text and full-color photographs to help readers recognize various kinds of North American trees. Although the illustrations are very attractive, many are insufficient for identifying a particular species. Wiggers frequently mentions tree shape, flowers, and seeds as identifying characteristics, but they are not always shown. Several of the photos show a mass of leaves at a distance so that it is difficult to see the shape of an individual leaf. C. Frank Brockman's Trees of North America (Golden, 1968) and Herbert S. Zim's Trees: A Guide to Familiar American Trees (Golden, 1956; o.p.) are better pictorial identification guides. --Barbara B.

Readers at every level will enjoy this book for its insights and message of hope: Light is available to all who seek it with humility and grace.<p>Within the world&#x2019;s sacred scriptures, many significant passages involve light&#x2014;be it the &#x201c;burning bush&#x201d; experience of the lawgiver Moses on Mount Sinai, the &#x201c;light brighter than a thousand suns&#x201d; of which the Bhagavad Gita speaks, or the teaching of Jesus of Nazareth, &#x201c;If thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be filled with light&#x201d; (Matthew 6:22, KJV).</p><p>We seek to highlight in this book those who have experienced this divine light. Numerous esoteric references to Inner Light appear not only in the scriptures of the distant past, but also within the personal experiential accounts by Masters, sages, and seers across the centuries. Also we draw upon wisdom stories and tales from many cultural and ethnic traditions.</p><p>We draw attention to a number of significant related references and accounts by teachers and practitioners of the closely related phenomenon of Inner Sound, which is also known within various teachings or mystic lineages as &#x201c;audible sound current,&#x201d; Naam, Word, &#x201c;celestial music,&#x201d; or other descriptions.</p><p>Testimonies are provided by persons who have experienced aspects of Inner Light and Sound in a variety of circumstances outside of formal religious or spiritual contexts. These may be precipitated, for example, by being profoundly moved by uplifting music, sudden personal epiphanies, near-death experiences (NDEs), and during the dying process itself.</p><p>One common thread among great teachers, sages and practitioners of spiritual traditions have emphasized throughout the ages is that Inner Light and enlightenment can be most directly accessed by utilizing meditation, prayer and other contemplative practices.</p><p>Today humankind collectively is faced with a host of great challenges: political, socio-economic, and ecological&#x2014;which ultimately at their roots are primarily spiritual in nature. Fortunately, possibilities for transformational changes are also accessible. Increasing numbers of people of all ages around the planet, both individuals and collectively, are seeking to tap into resources that will enhance self-understanding and recognition of a &#x201c;deeper&#x201d; shared level of Self and consciousness, within themselves and in the world.</p><p>Simply put, can enough persons of goodwill find sufficient common ground to pull together and live into being a unifying ethos for humanity? What will it take to build a nonviolent, sustainable world upon foundations of lovingkindness, compassion, cooperation and social justice?</p><p>It has becoming increasingly clear that there can be no real peace in the world until there is peace within and between religions. It is encouraging in this regard to witness increased participation among the faith traditions in interfaith dialogue. Harbingers of positive change include the &#x201c;new&#x201d; interspiritual movement, which attracts people from a wide range of perspectives and highlights a growing awareness that the basic core of spiritual experience emerges from the same wellspring(s).</p><p>We sincerity hope that Let There Be Light can help contribute to thoughtful questioning, appreciative listening, and openhearted dialogue as people with diverse origins come together to share their spiritual journeys with each other.</p></p><p>Arthur Stein (Art) is currently Professor Emeritus and a co-founder of the Center for Nonviolence and Peace Studies at the University of Rhode Island (URI).

In 1943, they both joined the Resistance, where Virginia put her life in jeopardy as she sheltered downed airmen and later survived a Nazi prison camp.

He studied in Berlin and Vienna and was first known as a poet and translator, then as a biographer. Between the wars, Zweig was an international bestseller with a string of hugely popular novellas including <i>Letter from an Unknown Woman, Amok</i> and <i>Fear.</i> In 1934, with the rise of Nazism, he left Austria, and lived in London, Bath and New York--a period during which he produced his most celebrated works: his only novel, <i>Beware of Pity,</i> and his memoir, <i>The World of Yesterday.</i> He eventually settled in Brazil, where in 1942 he and his wife were found dead in an apparent double suicide. Much of his work is available from Pushkin Press.FLIGHT INTO<br> IMMORTALITY<br> THE DISCOVERY OF<br> THE PACIFIC OCEAN<br> <i>25 September 1513</i><br><br> <i>A Ship Is Fitted Out</i><br> When he first returned from the newly discovered<br> continent of America, Columbus had displayed<br> countless treasures and curiosities on his triumphal<br> procession through the crowded streets of Seville<br> and Barcelona: human beings of a race hitherto<br> unknown, with reddish skins; animals never seen<br> before; colourful, screeching parrots; slow-moving<br> tapirs; then strange plants and fruits that would<br> soon find a new home in Europe&#x2014;Indian corn,<br> tobacco, the coconut. The rejoicing throng marvels<br> at all these things, but the royal couple and their<br> counsellors are excited above all by a few boxes<br> and baskets containing gold. Columbus does not<br> bring much gold back from the new Indies: a few<br> pretty things that he has bartered with the natives,<br> or stolen from them, a few small bars and several<br> handfuls of loose grains, gold dust rather than solid<br> gold&#x2014;the whole of it at most enough to mint a<br> few hundred ducats. But the inspired Columbus,<br> who always fanatically believes whatever he wants<br> to believe at any given time, and who has been<br>so gloriously proved right about his sea route to<br> India, boasts effusively and in all honesty that this<br> is only a tiny foretaste. Reliable news, he adds, has<br> reached him of gold mines of immeasurable extent<br> on these new islands; only just below the surface,<br> the precious metal, he says, lies under a thin layer<br> of soil in many fields, and you can easily dig it out<br> with an ordinary spade. Farther south, however,<br> there are realms where the kings drink from golden<br> goblets, and gold is worth less than lead at home in<br> Spain. The ever-avaricious king listens, intoxicated to<br> hear of this new Ophir that now belongs to him. No<br> one yet knows Columbus and his sublime folly well<br> enough to doubt his promises. A great fleet is fitted<br> out at once for the second voyage, and now there<br> is no need for recruiting officers and drummers to<br> find men to join it. Word of the newly discovered<br> Ophir, where you can pick up gold from the ground<br> with your bare hands, sends all Spain mad; people<br> come in their hundreds, their thousands to travel<br> to El Dorado, the land of gold.<br> But what a dismal tidal wave of humanity is now<br> cast up by greed from every city, every village, every<br> hamlet. Not only do honourable noblemen arrive,<br> wishing to gild their coats of arms, not only are<br> there bold adventurers and brave soldiers; all the<br> filthy scum of Spain is also washed up in Palos and<br> C�diz. There are branded thieves, highwaymen and<br>footpads hoping to find a more profitable trade in<br> the land of gold; there are debtors who want to<br> escape their creditors and husbands hoping to get<br> away from scolding wives; all the desperadoes and<br> failures, branded criminals and men sought by the<br> Alguacil justices volunteer for the fleet, a motley<br> band of failures who are determined that they<br> will make their fortunes at long last, in an instant<br> too, and to that end are ready to commit any act<br> of violence and any crime. They have told one<br> another the fantasies of Columbus, repeating that<br> in those lands you have only to thrust a spade into<br> the ground to see nuggets of gold glinting up at<br> you, and the prosperous among the emigrants hire<br> servants and mules to carry large quantities of the<br> precious metal away. Those who do not succeed in<br> being taken on by the expedition find another way:<br> never troubling to get the royal permission, coarsegrained<br> adventurers fit out ships for themselves,<br> in order to cross the ocean as fast as they can and<br> get their hands on gold, gold, gold. And at a single<br> stroke, Spain is rid of troublemakers and the most<br> dangerous kind of rabble.<br> The Governor of Espa�ola (later San Domingo<br> and Haiti) is horrified to see these uninvited guests<br> overrunning the island entrusted to his care. Year<br> after year the ships bring new freight and increasingly<br> rough, unruly fellows. The newcomers, in turn, are<br>bitterly disappointed. There is no sign of gold lying<br> loose on the road, and not another grain of corn<br> can be got out of the unfortunate native inhabitants<br> on whom these brutes descend. So hordes of them<br> wander around, intent on robbery, terrifying the<br> unhappy Indios and the governor alike. The latter<br> tries in vain to make them colonists by showing<br> them where land may be had, giving them cattle,<br> and indeed ample supplies of human cattle in the<br> form of sixty to seventy native inhabitants as slaves<br> to work for every one of them. But neither the<br> high-born hidalgos nor the former footpads have a<br> mind to set up as farmers. They didn&#x2019;t come here<br> to grow wheat and herd cattle; instead of putting<br> their minds to sowing seed and harvesting crops,<br> they torment the unfortunate Indios&#x2014;they will have<br> eradicated the entire indigenous population within<br> a few years&#x2014;or sit around in taverns. Within a short<br> time most of them are so deep in debt that after<br> their goods they have to sell their hats and coats,<br> their last shirts, and they fall into the clutches of<br> traders and usurers.<br> So in 1510 all these failures on Espa�ola are glad<br> to hear that a well-regarded man from the island,<br> the <i>bachiller </i>or lawyer Mart�n Fernandez de Enciso,<br> is fitting out a ship with a new crew to come to<br> the aid of his colony on terra firma. In 1509 two<br> famous adventurers, Alonzo de Ojeda and Diego de<br>Nicuesa, received the privilege from King Ferdinand<br> of founding a colony near the straits of Panama and<br> the coast of Venezuela, naming it rather too hastily<br> Castilla del Oro, Golden Castile. Intoxicated by<br> the resonant name and beguiled by tall stories, the<br> lawyer, who knew little about the ways of the world,<br> had put most of his fortune into this adventure.<br> But now no gold comes from the newly founded<br> colony in San Sebasti�n on the Gulf of Urab�, only<br> shrill cries for help. Half the crew have been killed<br> in fighting the native people, and the other half<br> have starved to death. To save the investment he<br> has already made, Enciso ventures the rest of his<br> fortune, and equips another expedition to go to the<br> aid of the original one. As soon as they hear that<br> Enciso needs soldiers, all the desperadoes and loafers<br> on Espa�ola exploit this opportunity and take ship<br> with him. Their aim is simply to get away, away<br> from their creditors and the watchful eyes of the<br> stern governor. But the creditors are also on their<br> guard. They realize that the worst of their debtors<br> intend to disappear, never to be seen again, and so<br> they besiege the governor with requests to let no one<br> travel without his special permission. The governor<br> grants their wish. A strict guard obliges Enciso&#x2019;s ship<br> to stay outside the harbour, while government boats<br> patrol the coastal waters to prevent anyone without<br> such permission from being smuggled aboard. And<br>all the embittered desperadoes, who fear death less<br> than honest work or their towering debts, watch as<br> Enciso&#x2019;s ship leaves on its venture with all sail set.</p><h2>The Inner Circle</h2><p>In 1940, innocent young John Milk accepts a job as an assistant to Dr. Alfred Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist who has taken up the study of human sexuality, and takes part, along with his beautiful wife, in a series of sexual experiments that become ever more uninhibited. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>T.C.

I don&#x2019;t know what he saw in me, really&#x2014;or perhaps I do. If you&#x2019;ll forgive me a moment of vanity, my wife, Iris, claims I was something of a heartthrob on campus, though I would have been the last to know of it because I wasn&#x2019;t dating and had always been uncomfortable with the sort of small talk that leads up to the casual inquiry about after-class plans or what you might or might not be doing on Saturday after the game. I had a pretty fair physique in those days, with a matching set of fullback&#x2019;s shoulders and a thirty-inch waist (I was first string on my high school team till I suffered a concussion midway through my junior season and my mother put a premature end to my career), and unlike most men at college, I was conscientious about keeping myself in trim&#x2014;I still am&#x2014;but that&#x2019;s neither here nor there. To complete the portrait, because already I&#x2019;ve managed to get myself out on a limb here, I was blessed with what Iris calls &#x201c;sensitive&#x201d; eyes, whatever that might mean, and a thatch of wheat-colored hair with a natural curl that defeated any cream or pomade I&#x2019;d ever come across. As for sex, I was eager but inexperienced, and shy in the usual way&#x2014;unsure of myself and just about as uninformed as anyone you could imagine.<p>In fact, the first time I developed anything more than a theoretical grasp of what coitus involved&#x2014;the mechanics of the act, that is&#x2014;was during my senior year at IU, in the fall of 1939, when I found myself sitting in a lecture hall jammed to the rafters with silent, dry-mouthed students of both sexes as Prok&#x2019;s color slides played hugely across the screen. I was there at the instigation of a girl named Laura Feeney, one of the campus femmes fatales who never seemed to go anywhere without an arm looped through some letterman&#x2019;s. Laura had the reputation of being &#x201c;fast,&#x201d; though I can assure you I was never the beneficiary of her sexual largesse (if, in fact, the rumors were true: as I was later to learn, the most provocative-looking women often have the most repressed sex lives, and vice versa). I remember being distinctly flattered when she stopped me in the corridor one day during fall registration, took hold of my arm at the muscle and pecked a kiss on my cheek.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hi, John,&#x201d; she breathed, &#x201c;I was just thinking about you. How was your summer?&#x201d;</p><p>My summer had been spent back home in Michigan City, stocking shelves and bagging groceries, and if I had five minutes to myself my mother had me pruning the trees, reshingling the roof and pulling weeds in the vegetable garden. I was lonely, bored to tears, masturbating twice a day in my attic room that was like a sweatbox in a penal institution. My only relief derived from books. I came under the spell of John Donne and Andrew Marvell that summer, and I reread Sir Philip Sidney&#x2019;s <i>Astrophel and Stella</i> three times in preparation for an English literature course I was looking forward to in the fall. But I couldn&#x2019;t tell Laura Feeney all this&#x2014;or any of it. She would have thought me a washout. Which I was. So I just shrugged and said, &#x201c;All right, I guess.&#x201d;</p><p>Voices reverberated in the stairwell, boomed in the corners and fled all the way down the corridor to where the registration tables had been set up in the gymnasium. &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Laura said, and her smile went cold a moment, &#x201c;I know how you feel. With me it was work, work, work&#x2014;my father owns a lunch counter in Fort Wayne, did you know that?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know. I shook my head and felt a whole shining loop of my hair fall loose, though I must have used half a bottle of cr�me oil on it. I was wearing one of the stiff new Arrow shirts my grandmother had sent me from Chicago and a glen-plaid tie I think I wore to class every day that year in the hope of making a good impression, my briefcase was in one hand, a stack of library books in the other. As I&#x2019;ve said, the gift of small talk eluded me. I think I said something like, &#x201c;Fort Wayne, huh?&#x201d;</p><p>In any event, it didn&#x2019;t matter what I said, because she let her turquoise eyes go wide (she was a redhead, or a strawberry blonde, actually, with skin so white you&#x2019;d think it had never seen the sun), gave my muscle a squeeze and lowered her voice. &#x201c;Listen,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I just wanted to know if you&#x2019;d mind getting engaged to me&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Her words hung there between us, closing out everything else&#x2014;the chatter of the group of freshmen materializing suddenly from the men&#x2019;s room, the sound of an automobile horn out on the street&#x2014;and I can only imagine the look I must have given her in response. This was long before Prok taught me to tuck all the loose strands of my emotions behind a mask of impassivity, and everything I was thinking routinely rushed to my face along with the blood that settled in my cheeks like a barometer of confusion.</p><p>&#x201c;John, you&#x2019;re not blushing, are you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;not at all. I&#x2019;m just&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>She held my eyes, enjoying the moment. &#x201c;Just what?&#x201d;</p><p>I shrugged. &#x201c;We were out in the sun&#x2014;yesterday it was, yesterday afternoon. Moving furniture. So, I guess, well&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Someone brushed by me, an undergraduate who looked vaguely familiar&#x2014;had he been in my psych class last year?&#x2014;and then she let the other shoe drop. &#x201c;I mean, just for the semester. For pretend.&#x201d; She looked away and her hair rose and fell in an ebbing wave. When she turned back to me, she lifted her face till it was like a satellite of my own, pale and glowing in the infusion of light from the windows at the end of the corridor. &#x201c;You know,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;for the marriage course?&#x201d;</p><p>That was the moment it all began, though I didn&#x2019;t realize it at the time&#x2014;how could I? How could I have foreseen that a shallow, manipulative girl I hardly knew would be the motive force that was to lead me to Prok and Mac, Corcoran, Rutledge, to the desk at which I&#x2019;m now sitting, trying to get as much of this out as I can before the world goes to pieces? I said, &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;Yes, all right,&#x201d; and Laura Feeney smiled and before I knew it I was on my way to becoming an initiate in the science of sex, abandoning the ideal for the actual, the dream of Stella (&#x201c;True, that true beauty virtue is indeed&#x201d;) for anatomy, physiology and an intimate knowledge of the Bartholin&#x2019;s glands and the labia minora. All of it&#x2014;all the years of research, the thousands of miles traveled, the histories taken, the delving and rooting and pioneering&#x2014;spun out like thread from an infinite spool held in the milk-white palm of Laura Feeney on an otherwise ordinary morning in the autumn of 1939.</p><p>But I don&#x2019;t want to make too much of it&#x2014;we all have our defining moments. And I don&#x2019;t mean to keep you in the dark here either. The &#x201c;marriage course&#x201d; to which Laura Feeney was referring&#x2014;Marriage and the Family, properly&#x2014;was being offered by Professor Kinsey of the Zoology Department and half a dozen of his colleagues from other disciplines, and it was the sensation of the campus. The course was open only to faculty and staff, students who were married or engaged, and seniors of both sexes. There were eleven lectures in all, five of them covering the sociological, psychological, economic, legal and religious facets of marriage, these to be delivered by faculty outside of the Zoology Department, and they were to prove to be informative enough, I suppose, and necessary, but if truth be told they were nothing more than window dressing for the six unexpurgated lectures (with audiovisual aids) Prok was scheduled to give on the physiology of intramarital relations.</p><p>Word was out on campus, and I suspect there were any number of junior girls like Laura Feeney shopping at the five-and-dime for rhinestone rings&#x2014;maybe even sophomores and freshmen too. My guess is that Laura&#x2019;s lettermen were engaged to their fall sports, and, by extension, their coaches, and so she cast me in the role of prospective bridegroom. I didn&#x2019;t mind. I would say she wasn&#x2019;t my type, but then all women are every man&#x2019;s type, under the right circumstances. She was popular, she was pretty, and if for an hour or two a week people took her to be mine, so much the better. To this point, I&#x2019;d been immersed in my studies&#x2014;I made dean&#x2019;s list five out of the first six semesters&#x2014;and I barely knew any girls, either on campus or back at home, and to have her there at my side as other couples strolled by and the late-blooming sun ladled syrup over the trees and the apparent world stood still for whole minutes at a time was like no feeling I&#x2019;d ever had. Was it love? I don&#x2019;t know. It was certainly something, and it stirred me&#x2014;I could always hope, couldn&#x2019;t I?</p><p>At any rate, as I say, word was out, and the lecture hall was full to overflowing when we got there the first day. I remember being surprised at the number of younger faculty crowding the front rows with their prim and upright wives and how many of them I didn&#x2019;t recognize. There was a sprinkling of older faculty too, looking lost and even vaguely queasy, and their presence was a real puzzle&#x2014;you would have thought people in their forties and fifties with grown children should be acquainted with the basic facts of life, but there they were. (&#x201c;Maybe they need a refresher course,&#x201d; Laura said with half a grin and very much sotto voce, and even that, even the barest mention of what those couples must have done in private&#x2014;or once have done&#x2014;made me go hot all over.) But of course the real multitude was composed of students&#x2014;there must have been three hundred or more of us there, crowded in shoulder to shoulder, all waiting to be scandalized, to hear the forbidden words spoken aloud and see the very act itself depicted in living color.</p><p>Dr. Hoenig, the Dean of Women, had been stationed at the door as we filed in, ready to pounce on anyone who wasn&#x2019;t on her list of registered students. She was a short, top-heavy woman in a dowdy dress and a gray cloche hat that seemed like an extension of her pinned-up hair, and though she must have been in her forties then she seemed to us as ancient and vigilant as the Sphinx, her spectacles shining as she bent to check names against the list and scrutinize the ring fingers of all the girls who claimed to be engaged. We passed muster, and sat through the preliminary lectures, biding our time until Dr. Kinsey took the stage. We&#x2019;d seen him at the outset&#x2014;he&#x2019;d electrified us all in his introductory lecture by claiming that there were no abnormalities when it came to sex, save for abstinence, celibacy and delayed marriage&#x2014;but then he&#x2019;d been succeeded by a doctor from the medical school whose voice was perfectly pitched to the frequency of sleep, and then a Methodist minister and a pinched little man from the Psychology Department who spoke ad nauseam on Freud&#x2019;s <i>Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality</i>.</p><p>It was raining, I remember, on the day we&#x2019;d all been waiting for&#x2014;the day of the slide presentation&#x2014;and as Laura Feeney and I stepped into the anteroom with the mob of other students divesting themselves of umbrellas and slickers, I was struck by the deep working odor of all that massed and anointed flesh. Laura must have noticed it too, because the minute she ducked demurely past Dean Hoenig, she wrinkled up her nose and whispered, &#x201c;Smells like somebody let all the tomcats loose.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know what to say to that, so I gave her a faint smile&#x2014;it wouldn&#x2019;t do at all to look as if I were enjoying myself, because this was education, after all, this was science, and every face had been ironed sober&#x2014;and allowed my right hand to rest lightly at her waist as I guided her through the crush and into the semi-darkened hall. We were fifteen minutes early, but already all the aisle seats had been taken and we had to edge awkwardly through a picket of folded knees, book bags and umbrellas to reach the middle of one of the back rows. Laura settled in, shook out her hair, waved to thirty or forty people I didn&#x2019;t recognize, then bent forward over her compact and stealthily reapplied her lipstick. She came up compressing her lips and giving me the sort of look she might have reserved for a little brother or maybe the family dog&#x2014;she was a junior from Fort Wayne and I was a senior from Michigan City and no matter how much I wanted to believe otherwise there was nothing, absolutely nothing, between us.</p><p>I gazed down the row. Nearly all the girls were glancing round them with shining eyes while the men fumbled with loose-leaf binders and worried over the nubs of their pencils. A man from my rooming house&#x2014;Dick Martone&#x2014;happened to glance up then and our eyes met briefly. Both of us looked away, but not before I could read his excitement. Here we were&#x2014;he wedged in between two other senior men, I with Laura Feeney preening at my side&#x2014;about to see and engage what we&#x2019;d been hungering after for the better part of our lives. I can&#x2019;t begin to describe the <i>frisson</i> that ran through that hall, communicated from seat to seat, elbow to elbow, through the whole yearning mass of us. Over the course of the past weeks we&#x2019;d been instructed in the history and customs of marriage, heard about the emotions evoked, the legal ramifications of the nuptial bond and even the anatomy of the structures involved in reproduction, heard the words &#x201c;penis,&#x201d; &#x201c;nipple,&#x201d; &#x201c;vagina&#x201d; and &#x201c;clitoris&#x201d; spoken aloud in mixed company, and now we were going to see for ourselves. I could feel the blood pounding in my extremities.</p><p>Then the side door swung open and Dr. Kinsey was there, striding purposefully to the podium. Though a moment before he&#x2019;d been slogging across campus in galoshes and southwester, you would have thought he&#x2019;d just stepped out of a sunlit meadow, the sheaf of his bristling flat-topped pompadour standing upright from the crown of his head as if it had been pressed from a mold, his dark suit, white shirt and bow tie impeccable, his face relaxed and youthful. He was in his mid-forties then, a looming tall presence with an oversized head, curiously narrowed shoulders and a slight stoop&#x2014;the result of the rickets he&#x2019;d suffered as a child&#x2014;and he never wasted a motion or a single minute of anybody&#x2019;s time either. The anticipatory murmur fell off abruptly as he stepped up to the lectern and raised his head to look out on the audience. Silence. Absolute. We all became aware of the sound of the rain then, a steady sizzle like static in the background.</p><p>&#x201c;Today we shall discuss the physiology of sexual response and orgasm in the human animal,&#x201d; he began, without preliminary, without notes, and as his equable, matter-of-fact tones penetrated the audience, I could feel Laura Feeney go tense beside me. I stole a glance at her. Her face was rapt, her white blouse glowing in the dimness of the lecture hall as if it were the single radiant point in the concave sweep of the audience. She was wearing knee socks and a pleated skirt that pulled tight to reveal the swell of the long muscles of her thighs. Her perfume took hold of me like a vise.</p><p>Professor Kinsey&#x2014;Prok&#x2014;went on, with the help of the overhead projector, to document how the penis enlarges through vasocongestion and at orgasm releases between two and five million spermatozoa, depending on the individual, and then turned his attention to the female reproductive organs. He talked ...</p></p><h2>Row Quilts, Longitudes &amp; Latitudes</h2><p><p>There isn't just one way to assemble a quilt, as this guide demonstrates.&nbsp;Quilters looking to understand quilt construction, visual appeal,&nbsp;and design options learn that&nbsp;placement and block combinations are the keys to success when designing quilts.

In Improving Your Serve, Chuck Swindoll shows the reader a fresh perspective on how to choose a fulfilling lifestyle. Readers will discover why a straight-from-the-heart generosity brings richer rewards than mere money or position will every buy. Improving Your Serve offers a case for unselfishness and shows why serving others can be a much more fulfilling way to live. Readers will also learn how a radical application of biblical principles of servanthood can transform him or her from the inside out -- and make a real and lasting difference in today's world. Improving Your Serve will help the reader build the foundation for a happy and fulfilled life through demonstrating love for others. By following the principles outlined in Improving Your Serve anyone can become a more authentic person, a warm and transparent human being who lives out real love in the real world. Improving Your Serve is one of Charles Swindoll's finest literary efforts in his crusade to spread Christian teachings, ethics, philosophy, and practices throughout a secular world sadly in need of what the Gospel has to offer. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Henry Miller: Stories, Essays, Travel Sketches</h2><p>Beautiful Hennry Miller book.

Old favorites like Kick the Can, Fox and Geese, and Red Rover encouraged camaraderie, physical activity, coordination and social interaction--as electronic and computer games never can. Family and campfire singalongs helped preserve the folksong and storytelling tradition while instilling in children a sense of community and a confidence in their musical capability. Writer and poet Sharon O&#39;Bryan has gathered a collection of the old games and songs. She brings the old days back to life with instructions for outdoor games like King of the Mountain; car games like Graveyard; card games including Old Maid; and favorite party games such as Blind Man&#39;s Bluff.

Bush<br>EARLY ON the afternoon of May 1, 2002, George W. Bush slipped out of the Oval Office, grabbed a tennis racquet, and headed to the South Lawn. He had a few spare moments for one of his recreational pleasures: whacking tennis balls to his dogs, Spot and Barney. It was a pleasant spring day in Washington and not an especially taxing one for the president. He had no pressing political worries. Having routed the Taliban regime in Afghanistan the previous fall, Bush was standing tall in the polls, with an approval rating hovering at 70 percent. That morning, there had been his usual terrorism briefings, then meetings with congressional leaders where Bush had talked about moving forward his domestic proposals, including a measure promoting faith-based social programs. Later in the day, the president was due to meet the vice president of China. Bush also had an unusual press interview on his schedule that afternoon. As he hit the balls and watched the dogs scamper, Bush prepared for that session with two press aides by reviewing questions he would likely be asked about one of his predecessors he admired most: Ronald Reagan. <br>Ever since September 11, 2001, Bush had increasingly identified with Reagan: his optimism, his firm convictions, his stark, uncompromising stand against Soviet communism. Bush had come to consider Reagan&#x2019;s battle against the Soviet Union a parallel of his own struggle against Islamic extremism. The Evil Empire was now the Axis of Evil&#x2013;that trio of tyrannies, Iraq, Iran, and North Korea, that Bush had proclaimed the nation&#x2019;s foes months earlier during his first State of the Union speech. <br>Frank Sesno, the veteran newscaster, was due shortly at the White House to query Bush about Reagan and the parallels between his presidency and Bush&#x2019;s. The interview was for a History Channel special that would air upon the death of the former president, who was ninety-one years old and suffering from advanced Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease. On a two-page &#x201c;pre-brief &#x201d; memo prepared by his staff and containing questions that might be asked,Bush had written out by hand points he wanted to emphasize. The presidential scribbles, his aides thought, were revealing&#x2013;perhaps a window onto Bush&#x2019;s view of himself. &#x201c;Optimism and strength,&#x201d; Bush had scrawled on top of the memo. Also, &#x201c;decisive&#x201d; and &#x201c;faith.&#x201d; Next to a question about Reagan&#x2019;s direct, blunt style, Bush had written, &#x201c;moral clarity.&#x201d; He had drawn an arrow next to the word &#x201c;forceful.&#x201d; Alongside a question about the 1983 suicide bombing attack on the U.S. Marines barracks in Lebanon (which killed 241 American troops) and how a president copes with such losses, Bush had written, &#x201c;There will be casualties.&#x201d;<br>On the South Lawn, Press Secretary Ari Fleischer and another member of the communications staff, a burly, irrepressible former television producer named Adam Levine, reviewed these points with Bush. Then they all moved inside and headed upstairs to the Red Room so Bush could have makeup applied for the interview. Bush casually asked Fleischer how his day had been going and what the talk in the pressroom was. Fleischer mentioned Helen Thomas, the longtime correspondent then writing for Hearst News Service. She was a gadfly and constantly giving Fleischer a tough time about an issue much in the news: Iraq. Bush and other administration officials had been decrying Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, as a threat to the United States and the world. To many, it sounded like war talk. The media were filled with speculation that the White House was preparing for an invasion. But Bush had steadfastly refused to state his intentions. His aides repeatedly claimed that Bush had reached no decisions. Interviewed by a British broadcaster a few weeks earlier, Bush had resorted to a Clintonesque evasion: &#x201c;I have no plans to attack on my desk.&#x201d;<br>At that day&#x2019;s daily press briefing, Thomas had peppered Fleischer with questions about Iraq. Referring to stories in the media about secret plans for military action, she asked, &#x201c;What is the president&#x2019;s rationale for invading Iraq?&#x201d; What made Saddam different from other dictators and worth an invasion? Fleischer bantered with Thomas and pointed out that &#x201c;regime change&#x201d; in Iraq had been the official policy of the U.S. government since President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act in 1998. Thomas shot back: Did the law mandate that the United States overthrow the Iraqi government by force? Bush, Fleischer said, &#x201c;believes that the people of Iraq, as well as the region, will be more peaceful, better off without Saddam Hussein.&#x201d; Thomas retorted, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not a reason&#x201d; to go to war. &#x201c;Well, Helen,&#x201d; Fleischer replied, &#x201c;if you were the president, you could have vetoed the law.&#x201d; The reporters chuckled, and Fleischer called on another journalist. <br>As Fleischer recounted this exchange for the president, Bush&#x2019;s mood changed, according to Levine. He grew grim and determined&#x2013;steely. Out of nowhere, he unleashed a string of expletives. <br>&#x201c;Did you tell her I don&#x2019;t like motherfuckers who gas their own people?&#x201d; the president snapped.<br>&#x201c;Did you tell her I don&#x2019;t like assholes who lie to the world?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Did you tell her I&#x2019;m going to kick his sorry motherfucking ass all over the Mideast?&#x201d;<br>Fleischer paused. &#x201c;I told her half of that,&#x201d; he replied. Bush laughed, as did his aides. Still, Bush&#x2019;s visceral reaction was telling. This wasn&#x2019;t bluster; this was real. The president had meant what he said&#x2013;every word of it. This was the Bush that Levine admired. &#x201c;You know where we&#x2019;re going here,&#x201d; Levine thought.<br>The vice president&#x2019;s limousine sped through downtown Washington and headed over the Potomac River on its way to Langley, Virginia. It was days after Bush&#x2019;s outburst, and Dick Cheney was making another of his visits to CIA headquarters. These trips&#x2013;unknown to the public at this point&#x2013;had become the talk of the intelligence community. Cheney would arrive at agency headquarters and park himself in Director George Tenet&#x2019;s seventhfloor conference room. Then officers and analysts would be summoned to brief him&#x2013;on Iraq and other matters&#x2013;and often encounter a withering interrogation. How do we know this? What more do you have on that? What have you done to follow up? Cheney was proper and respectful. His questions were delivered in his soft, low, monotone voice, his arms folded. Still, they had an intimidating impact on his briefers. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen him people,&#x201d; said John Maguire, an Iraq covert operations officer who often attended the Cheney briefings. &#x201c;He would drill in on substantive details. If he asked you something that you didn&#x2019;t know, you better have an answer the next time you saw him. . . . He would say, &#x2018;I want answers on this. This is not acceptable.&#x2019; &#x201d; The worst thing to do with Cheney was to hedge or to waffle. &#x201c;He&#x2019;d say, &#x2018;Make a call,&#x2019; &#x201d; Maguire recalled. He didn&#x2019;t want to hear sentences that began, &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br>During these sessions, Cheney demanded answers on Iraq. Cheney had long-standing and firm views on Saddam Hussein that went back to when he had served as secretary of defense during the first Persian Gulf War. Cheney had been convinced then that the CIA had blown it by badly underestimating how close Saddam had been to building a nuclear bomb before that war. And ever since the cataclysmic events of September 11, Cheney seemed obsessed with Iraq. He was sure that Saddam was a grave threat to the United States&#x2013;and that the agency was missing the crucial intelligence that would prove it. In February 2002, Cheney had seized on a murky item presented to him during his daily morning briefing from the CIA: a report forwarded to the CIA by Italian military intelligence that Iraq had arranged to purchase 500 tons of yellowcake uranium from the impoverished African nation of Niger. If the report was accurate&#x2013;if there had been such a transaction&#x2013;this would be compelling evidence Iraq had revived a moribund nuclear weapons program that had been dismantled in the mid-1990s under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency. But there was nothing to substantiate the report, and parts of it did not make sense. Still, Cheney had jumped on it. What more can you get on this? he had asked his CIA briefer. What more can you find out? As always, the answer from the CIA was, We&#x2019;ll get on this right away. And it did. <br>Another issue Cheney fixated on was Baghdad&#x2019;s ties to terrorists, especially the allegations of a connection between Saddam and al-Qaeda. The agency would write up answers to the vice president&#x2019;s repeated questions and send them to his office, often reporting that there was little to substantiate Cheney&#x2019;s darkest suspicions of an operational alliance between Saddam and Osama bin Laden. But Cheney and his hard-nosed chief of staff, I. Lewis Libby (who went by the nickname of Scooter), were never satisfied and continually asked for more. &#x201c;It was like they were hoping we&#x2019;d find something buried in the files or come back with a different answer,&#x201d; Michael Sulick, deputy chief of the CIA&#x2019;s Directorate of Operations, later said. There was no &#x201c;obvious pressure&#x201d; by Cheney and Libby to change the answers, Sulick recalled. But the barrage of questions and the frequent visits by the vice president had created an environment that was subtly, but unmistakably, influencing the agency&#x2019;s work. The CIA&#x2019;s analysts, Sulick believed, had become &#x201c;overly eager to please.&#x201d;<br>Libby may have been harder to please than Cheney.

Laroche uses a collage cut-and-paste style to emphasize the clutter and almost overwhelming offerings of a general store. Several double-page spread illustrations further add to the sense of unlimited supply in limited space. The dark blues, greens, and browns accurately portray the decor of that era. Parker's work emphasizes the child's perspective, which is the poem's intention. She uses bright crayon drawings to create the young girl's dream store. Individual objects are featured in full-page illustrations. Laroche's version is probably a more realistic portrayal of the general store as it existed. Overall, Laroche's illustrations are a clever recreation of of a time and place, but Parker's version has much greater appeal for children. Heide Piehler, Shorewood Public Library, Wis.<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Laroche, who created brilliant paper collages for Lois Lenski's Sing a Song of People , now brings the same confetti-bright image-making to Field's lyrical wish list of a child's dreams of a general store (a story also illustrated recently by Nancy Winslow Parker). Two friends visit the girl-owner of the store, preparing a basket for a picnic; as the three of them gather fixings from the various parts of the store, all of its nooks and crannies are revealed: shelves of canned and boxed goods, a refrigerator full of dairy products, bins of miscellany, a glass showcase of baked goods. Laroche's papercut figures are at home in this textured world, and the pages can be pored over frequently and still offer up new surprises in composition and contrast.

The book describes Edmund's early years in an exceptionally devout&nbsp;Plymouth Brethren&nbsp;home. His mother, who died early and painfully of breast cancer, was a writer of Christian&nbsp;tracts. His father&nbsp;was an influential, though largely self-taught,&nbsp;invertebrate zoologist&nbsp;and student of&nbsp;marine biology&nbsp;who, after his wife's death, took Edmund to live in&nbsp;Devon. The book focuses on the relationship between a sternly religious father who rejects the new evolutionary theories of his scientific colleague&nbsp;Charles Darwin&nbsp;and the son's gradual coming of age and rejection of his father's&nbsp;fundamentalist&nbsp;religion.&nbsp;It was immediately acclaimed for its courage in flouting the conventions of Victorian autobiography and is still a moving account of self-discovery.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Most of us take for granted our right to choose the life of the mind over that of the spirit without feeling remorse. At the very least, we've learned that the two need not be mutually exclusive. But this is hard-won ease, born of a conflict that began with the Victorians. Edmund Gosse's <i>Father and Son</i> (1907) traces his own reckoning--as well as that of his father, the eminent British zoologist Philip Gosse--with the clash. His story is, as he declares, "The diagnosis of a dying Puritanism."<p> The only Puritanism that dies here, however, is the author's. His parents were Christian fundamentalists and as a result, young Edmund was denied interaction with other children as well as all variety of fictional tales. "Here was perfect purity," Gosse writes, "perfect intrepidity, perfect abnegation; yet there was also narrowness, isolation, and absence of perspective, let it boldly be admitted, an absence of humanity." Despite all of this, the child maintained his sense of humor, which adds much levity to a tale of such potentially grim proportions.</p><p> When Edmund was 8, his mother died of cancer, leaving him the care of a man in whom "sympathetic imagination ... was singularly absent." Philip Gosse held on to his faith in God above all else--so much so, in fact, that when evolutionary theory was announced to the world, he dismissed it entirely because it discounted the book of Genesis. Little by little, Edmund began to chafe against the traditions he had inherited. By the age of 11, he already saw himself "imprisoned for ever in the religious system which had caught me and would whurl my helpless spirit." At this point he believed his fate was sealed and went through the motions of piety. It is not until he goes off to boarding school, and discovers the Greeks and Romantic poetry, that he slowly chooses his own path. Eventually he comes to realize that he and his father "walked in opposite hemispheres of the soul." Their split encapsulates a particular moment in history but also embodies their destiny: "one was born to fly backward, the other could not help being carried forward." <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p><b>Sir Edmund William Gosse</b>&nbsp;(1849&nbsp;&#x2013; 1928) was an English poet, author and critic.

We meet a drummer boy idolizing Napoleon, an irrepressibly mischievous grandmother who refuses to apologize to God on Judgment Day, and an androgynous (and luminous) Joan of Arc.<br><br>"Represented on a graph, Tsvetaeva's work would exhibit a curve - or rather, a straight line - rising at almost a right angle because of her constant effort to raise the pitch a note higher, an idea higher ... She always carried everything she has to say to its conceivable and expressible end. In both her poetry and her prose, nothing remains hanging or leaves a feeling of ambivalence. Tsvetaeva is the unique case in which the paramount spiritual experience of an epoch (for us, the sense of ambivalence, of contradictoriness in the nature of human existence) served not as the object of expression but as its means, by which it was transformed into the material of art." --Joseph Brodsky<br><br><i>While your eyes follow me into the grave, write up the whole caboodle on my cross! 'Her days began with songs, ended in tears, but when she died, she split her sides with laugher!'</i><br>--from <i>Moscow in the Plague Year: Poems</i></p><p>Marina Tsvetaeva (1892-1941) was a Russian poet and memoirist. Tsvetaeva's work was admired by many poets of her time, including Rainer Maria Rilke, Boris Pasternak, and Joseph Brodsky, among others. The Russian Revolution prompted Tsvetaeva's husband to join the White Army, and she and her young children were trapped in Moscow and thrown into extreme poverty for five years, the subject of the poems in <i>Moscow in the Plague Year</i>. In 1941 her husband was shot on the charge of espionage, her daughter sent to a labor camp, and Tsvetaeva herself sent to Yelabuga, where she found herself once more desperately looking for work until her suicide later that year. The author lives in Moscow, Russia."A poet of genius." <b>--Vladimir Nabokov</b><br><br>"Unique, profound, passionate, inspiring ... Asks questions we didn't know existed until she offered them to us, and answers to some of poetry's most enduring mysteries."<b> --C.K. Williams</b><br><br>"Although generally less well known here than Pasternak, Akhmatova and Mandelstam, Tsvetaeva is counted by some critics as the greatest of these four major poets of postrevolutionary Russia ... Infused with high passion and a heroic tenacity of spirit." <b>--<i>Publishers Weekly<br><br></i></b>"colloquial, witty and most welcome [...].&nbsp;Whyte&#x2019;s contribution to the &#x2018;English&#x2019; Tsvetaeva, apart from the focus of the selection which gives the reader the opportunity really to get to know the poet as a young woman caught up by the tornado of war and revolution, is [...] the way he reflects her edgy humor [...] and her pithy self-characterisations [...]. Tsvetaeva&#x2019;s visual imagery is superbly conveyed [...] as are her sustained, ephemeral metaphors.&nbsp;What a fine feeling for language to say &#x2018;on&#x2019;, not &#x2018;in&#x2019; the sky, so that we see not just the rainbow name MARINA, but the industrious adolescent stretching up to spell it out.

Cover with film wrap and refrigerate until needed. Cut the remaining peppers into 1-inch pieces. Place in a 2 1/2 -quart saucepan with 1 cup lightly salted water and bring to a boil over medium high heat. Lower the heat and simmer until all the water has evaporated, about 45 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes, then pur�e in a food processor fitted with a metal blade. Refrigerate, uncovered, for 15 minutes.<br><br>Prepare the pasta dough by placing 3 cups flour on a clean, dry cutting board or similar work surface. Make a well in the center, add the eggs, cooled pepper pur�e, olive oil, and 1 teaspoon salt. Using a fork, combine the eggs, pepper pur�e, olive oil, and salt. When thoroughly mixed, begin to work the flour into the center, a small amount at a time. When enough flour has been added so that you can handle the dough, begin kneading by hand. Knead the dough by hand until all the flour has been incorporated, about 10 minutes. Cover the dough with film wrap and allow to relax at room temperature for 1 hour.<br><br>Cut the pasta dough into 8 equal portions. Roll and knead each portion of dough through a pasta machine, using the extra 1/4 cup flour as necessary to prevent the dough from becoming tacky. Cut the sheets of dough into capellini (see page 359). To prevent sticking, toss the cut pasta with cornmeal, then place the cut pasta portions on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Cover the sheet tightly with film wrap and refrigerate until needed.<br><br>Prepare a garlic butter by heating 2 tablespoons butter in a non-stick saut� pan over medium heat. When the butter is hot, add 2 tablespoons minced shallots, season with salt and pepper, and saut� for 1 minute. Add 6 tablespoons wine and continue to heat until the wine has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Allow the reduced wine and shallot mixture to cool at room temperature for 30 minutes; then combine with 6 tablespoons butter, the chopped parsley, and 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic. Season with salt and pepper and keep at room temperature.<br><br>dHeat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a non-stick saut� pan over medium high heat. When the butter is hot, add the remaining 4 tablespoons minced shallots and 2 tablespoons minced garlic and saut� for 1 minute. Add the snails, season with salt and pepper, and saut� until hot, about 3 to 4 minutes. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons wine and the brandy. Reduce the heat and cook slowly for 15 minutes. Cool at room temperature for 30 minutes.<br><br>Combine the chicken pieces with the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper. Skewer the snails and chicken pieces, alternating 6 pieces of each item per skewer. The skewers may be prepared up to this point and refrigerated until needed.<br><br>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.<br><br>Grill the skewers and red pepper strips over a low charcoal or wood fire, turning regularly, for 4 to 5 minutes. While the skewers are cooking, baste with a small amount of garlic butter. Transfer the skewers and pepper strips to a baking sheet and once again baste with a small amount of garlic butter. Hold warm in the preheated oven.<br><br>Cook the pasta (see page 359) in 3 quarts boiling salted water until tender but firm to the bite, about 20 seconds. Drain the cooked pasta in a colander, return to the pan, and toss with the remaining garlic butter.<br><br>Portion the pasta onto 8 warm soup/pasta plates. Place 1 skewer and 4 grilled pepper strips on each portion of pasta and serve immediately.<br><br><b><i>The Chef's Touch</i></b><br><br>The preparation of fresh snails is an arduous task, but fortunately one that a cook on this side of the Atlantic need not worry about, since fresh snails are rarely, if ever, available in the United States. The snails available are canned and usually come from France or Taiwan, although recently a delicious canned tiny snail from California has come on the market. For this recipe, I recommend that a 24-count (2 dozen per can) snail from France or Taiwan be used; the California snail is too tiny for skewering and grilling.<br><br>Smaller skewers of chicken and snails, basted with garlic butter, would make an excellent hot hors d'oeuvres.<br><br>A sauvignon blanc with just the right balance of fruit and acidity would be my wine selection.

Dress each plate with 1/4 cup of the chilled dressing and serve.<br><br><b><i>The Chef's Touch</i></b><br><br>In this recipe, our variation on an old theme, we have the subtle smoke-flavored duck riding on the sweetness of the melon, countered by the saltiness of the country ham, which, in turn, is set off by the elegance of the pistachio dressing.<br><br>Although we have used pistachios in this recipe, other nuts, such as cashews or macadamia nuts, would also work well with the flavors of the duck, melon, and country ham.<br><br>The country ham used at The Trellis is a salt-cured and hickory-smoked product. The assertive flavor of this ham requires that it be used in judicious amounts. In this particular recipe, it is essential that the ham be sliced very thin. As you will only need a small amount (2 ounces), it will probably be more practical for you to purchase fully cooked salt-cured ham already sliced thin from your local delicatessen or fancy food store.<br><br>What to do with the duck legs, you are asking yourself? Marinate them in red wine for three days and grill. Or, if you have doubled or tripled the recipe and have several pairs on hand, you might want to cure them (see page 105).<br><br>We first served this appetizer at The Trellis in May 1981, for our premier Virginia vintners' barrel tasting. That evening, we paired the duck, melon, and ham with an openly fruity 1980 Ingelside Vineyards seyval blanc.

Humiliations, filth, stench, and physical abuse comprise the asphyxiating atmosphere of a halfway house for indigents in Miami where, in a shaken mental state, the writer William Figueras lives after his exile from Cuba. He claims to have gone crazy after the Cuban government judged his first novel &#x201c;morose, pornographic, and also irreverent, because it dealt harshly with the Communist Party,&#x201d; and prohibited its publication. By the time he arrives in Miami twenty years later, he is a &#x201c;toothless, skinny, frightened guy who had to be admitted to a psychiatric ward that very day&#x201d; instead of the ready-for-success exile his relatives expected to welcome and receive among them.

Most of us install a commonly available anti-virus program, mind our clicks, and hope for the best. More than that seems like work, and stories of data theft have become so ubiquitous that a certain amount of desensitization is probably inevitable. Well, Goodman's book should take care of that. When your C.V. includes titles like "futurist-in-residence with the FBI," you've seen who's creeping through those internet pipes, and it's harrowing; his litany of cyber criminals and their multitudinous misdeeds are often shocking in their inventiveness and audacity, and Goodman brings the nightmares one after another at an almost breathless pace. But not all is hopeless--Goodman aims to educate, offering from high-level policy to practical layman's advice for buttoning down your own data. Despite the scare factor, it's a fun, fast, and fascinating 400 pages. My only quibble is with the title, which implies a coming threat. The threat is here, and the future is now. --<em>Jon Foro</em></p><p>MARC GOODMAN has spent a career in law enforcement, including work as Futurist with the FBI, Senior Advisor to Interpol and street police officer.

A wandering actor returns to his hometown against his better instincts and runs into an old friend, who recounts their teenage days of stealing cars, scoring Benzedrine, and sleeping with whores in Tijuana. A Minnesota family travels south for a winter vacation but, caught up in the ordinary tyrannies of family life, remains oblivious to the beauty of the Yucat�n Peninsula. A solitary horse rancher muses on Sitting Bull and Beckett amid the jumble of stuff in his big country kitchen&#x2014;from rusted spurs and Lakota dream-catchers to yellowing pictures of hawks and galloping horses to &#x201c;snapshots of different sons in different shirts doing different things like fishing, riding mules and tractors; leaning up against their different mothers at radical angles.&#x201d;<br><br>Made up of short narratives, lyrics, and dialogues, <i>Day out of Days</i> sets conversation against tale, song against memory, in a cubistic counterpoint that finally links each piece together. The result is a stunning work of vision and clarity imbued with the vivid reverberations of myth&#x2014;Shepard at his flinty-eyed, unwavering best.</p><p><p>Sam Shepard is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of more than forty-five plays. As an actor, he has appeared in more than thirty films, and received an Oscar nomination in 1984 for <i>The Right Stuff</i>. He was a finalist for the W. H. Smith Literary Award for his story collection <i>Great Dream of Heaven</i>. He lives in New York and Kentucky.</p>Kitchen<br><br>I&#x2019;ve always done my best work in the kitchen. I don&#x2019;t know why. Cooking stuff up. Maybe that&#x2019;s it. Now I&#x2019;ve got my own kitchen deep in the country with a big round table smack in the middle. But I am surrounded. I&#x2019;m not sure who put all this stuff in here. Who jumbled all this up on my white brick walls as though it told some story, made some sense; some whole world out of floating fractured bits and pieces. Pencil drawing of Seattle Slew, long after retirement&#x2014;bloated pasture-belly, glazed far-off stare in his eye as though looking back to the glory days of the Triple Crown. And, wedged between the glass and flat black frame, snapshots of different sons in different shirts doing different things like fishing, riding mules and tractors; leaning up against their different mothers at radical angles. Postcards of nineteenth-century Lakota warriors like Gaul, adopted son of Sitting Bull, price on his head; left for dead only to come back and seek his perfect vengeance at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Henry Miller with a walking stick, black beret, sitting on a rock wall gesticulating to the camera, some quote about morality and why don&#x2019;t we just give ourselves over completely and unabashedly to the present, since we&#x2019;re all up against the same grim prospect anyway; same sinking ship. Slaves in sepia tone, harvesting bluegrass seed and whistling &#x201c;Dixie.&#x201d; Wedged between the tile and brick, more pix of hawks and galloping horses out near where we used to chase skinny coyotes back into the tangled mesquite and ocotillo. Then Beckett&#x2019;s sorrowful bespectacled hawk-face, gazing into oblivion with no trace of self-pity, resigned, hands clasped between his knees. Underneath in neat black scrawl: &#x201c;There is no return game between a man and his stars.&#x201d;<br><br>Who scrambled all this stuff in here with no seeming regard for associative order, shape, or color? Without the slightest care for where it might all wind up. Just randomly pinned to cupboards and door frames, slipping sideways; gathering spotted stove grease and fly shit. El Santuario de Chimay�, for instance, caked in Christmas snow, but what&#x2019;s it doing right next door to a business card for my horseshoer with an anvil and hammer logo? Then, working up the wall, there&#x2019;s the little bay in Lubec, Maine, where another set of rum-running ancestors lay long buried, then magic stones from Bernalillo, Wounded Knee, the painted stick, guts of the dream catcher, antelope, prairie dog, old speckled racing greyhounds flying off the tailgates; rusted spurs on the back of the black walnut door. What&#x2019;s all this shit for? Some display for who? For me? What for? Some guest or other? I have no guests. You know that. I&#x2019;m no host. Never have been. Maybe the old Sonoran man who drops off split oak but no real visitors, that&#x2019;s for sure. Everyone knows to stay far away. Especially now with the tiger-brindled pit bull out front. The screaming burro kicking buckets down the hill. The fighting gallo in attack mode. I&#x2019;m in this bunker all my own, surrounded by mysterious stuff. It may be time to take a break and walk back out into the dripping black woods where I know the hollowed-out Grandaddy Sycamore sits and waits for you to climb inside and breathe up into its bone-white aching arms.<br>Haskell, Arkansas<br><br>(Highway 70)<br>Sunday, midday. Not many cars. Man&#x2019;s out for a stroll. He comes across a head in a ditch by the side of the road; walks right past it, thinking he hasn&#x2019;t seen what he&#x2019;s just seen; thinking it&#x2019;s not possible. He stops. His heart starts picking up a little. His breath gets choppy. He&#x2019;s shaking now and he&#x2019;s never understood why his body always takes over in moments of panic like this; why his body refuses to listen to his head. He turns and goes back. He stops again and stares down into the ditch. There it is. Big as life. He&#x2019;s staring straight at it. A severed head in a wicker basket. He picks up a stick and pokes it like he&#x2019;s done before with dead dogs or deer. The skin puffy and blue and the eyes shut tight, squinting as though frozen in the moment of amputation. The head sporting a Pancho Villa&#x2013;style moustache; two buckteeth slightly visible; a single spot of blood on the lower lip. No other signs of gore. No dangling arteries or purple mess. It&#x2019;s a cleanly decapitated head resting flat in the bottom of a basket with what looks like burlap tucked neatly around the abbreviated neck. Black locks of matted hair dangle in snaky coils down both ears. The body is nowhere in sight. The man is relieved about that. In fact, he hopes he doesn&#x2019;t stumble across it in the same way he came across the head. That might be more than he could handle at this point.<br><br>Suddenly, the head starts to speak to the man in a soft, lilting voice. The eyes of the head don&#x2019;t open; the lips don&#x2019;t move. The voice just seems to be floating out the top of the skull. It&#x2019;s a humble, quiet kind of voice with no accent that the man can make out. Maybe the islands. The head asks the man if he&#x2019;ll kindly pick up the basket and carry it to a place it would prefer to be. A tranquil place not too far from here, away from the pounding sun and the roar of traffic. The head tells the man it&#x2019;s been hard for him to think straight in this miserable ditch. Panic takes hold of the man and he runs. He runs so fast and desperately that he quickly exhausts himself and falls down flat on his face. He hasn&#x2019;t fallen so completely flat as this since he was a little kid running away from his father; running for his life. With his teeth in the dirt the man hears the head calling out to him in the most forlorn and melancholy voice the man has ever heard. It makes his whole heart ache. The man pulls himself up off the ground, spitting little grains of sand. He turns and returns to the head. He can&#x2019;t help himself. His heart is pounding wildly. He tells the head he doesn&#x2019;t want to be involved; this was purely accidental, this meeting between the two of them, and he wants to just continue on his way as though the whole thing never happened. The head pleads with the man and the voice of the head is so full of yearning that the man remains rooted to the ground. The head tells him he&#x2019;s been calling out for days to the passing cars but no one hears him, no one stops. The man is the first one to stop. This makes the man feel important somehow; the idea that he might be some kind of hero. He likes that idea and his heart begins to relax and return to normal. The man asks the head, very tentatively, where it is he might want to be taken and the head answers, &#x201c;A lake, not too far from here. It won&#x2019;t take very long. You can just throw me into the flat water and then be on your way.&#x201d; The man considers for a moment then agrees to carry the head on one condition and that is that the head will please not speak to him anymore other than to give him simple clear directions on how to get to the lake and, above all, he should never again make that mournful, melancholy sound. The head agrees eagerly to all this and immediately goes silent.<br><br>When the man bends over to pick up the head in the basket he discovers it&#x2019;s much heavier than he would have imagined. It must weigh fifty pounds or more. Dead weight. The head laughs then quickly stops itself, not wanting to anger the man; not wanting the man to think he&#x2019;s being made fun of. The man hoists the basket up to his waist and carries the head a few yards on his hip, like a mother would carry an infant, then sets it down, panting and gasping. The head laughs in spite of itself and the man becomes angry, just as the head had anticipated. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d; demands the man but the head won&#x2019;t answer. The man immediately storms off feeling that he&#x2019;s been the brunt of some joke. The head calls out again in the most heartbreaking, plangent voice the man has ever heard. It stops him cold in his tracks. &#x201c;You promised me you wouldn&#x2019;t make that awful sound again!&#x201d; the man screams.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; says the head, &#x201c;but it&#x2019;s the only way to get your attention.&#x201d; The man walks reluctantly back to the head and stops in front of it. He feels now that he&#x2019;s hooked on this head. He stares down at it. The head is silent again. The eyes remain closed and squinting tight. There seems to be no life in the head at all. The man knows different. &#x201c;How did you get separated from your body?&#x201d; asks the man point-blank. This is the question that&#x2019;s been haunting him.<br><br>&#x201c;I was beheaded,&#x201d; says the head.<br><br>&#x201c;How?&#x201d; asks the man.<br><br>&#x201c;By a gleaming silver saber,&#x201d; says the head.<br><br>&#x201c;But who held the saber? Who brought it down on your neck?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never saw it coming,&#x201d; says the head.<br><br>&#x201c;But you must have known it was coming,&#x201d; says the man.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but it didn&#x2019;t help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; says the man.<br><br>&#x201c;Knowing. Knowing didn&#x2019;t help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, you have no idea who it might have been?&#x201d; asks the man.<br><br>&#x201c;I have many ideas but it doesn&#x2019;t matter now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you want to seek your vengeance?&#x201d; asks the man. The head starts laughing and can&#x2019;t stop. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t laugh at me!&#x201d; screams the man. The head stops. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand that,&#x201d; says the man. &#x201c;All my life I&#x2019;ve been laughed at.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; says the head.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t carry you, that&#x2019;s for sure. You&#x2019;re way too heavy,&#x201d; says the man and the head begins to weep. Tears roll out of the squinting eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; says the man. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t stand it if you do that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my only chance,&#x201d; says the head, trying to cont...</p><h2>The History of the Kings of Britain</h2><p>hardcover with slipcase</p><p></p><h2>Self-hypnosis in Two Days</h2><p>Self help book, How to hyptnotize yourself.

Fresh on the heels of her witchcraft trial, I feared the beautiful widowed sorceress had arrived to curse me. I glanced to Mr. McDonald only to find rumpled sheets and a fading crease in his pillow.</p><p>Moonlight streamed through the unlatched front door and drew me from my bed and across the one-room cottage, past the glowing embers of the hearth. My aching heart momentarily forgotten, I peered into the night and saw the witch standing in the yard. Her wild red hair unbound and her gaunt, pale face illuminated by the heavens. She spoke in hard, desperate tones to Mr. McDonald, who wore work pants and boots pulled on hurriedly under his nightshirt. When I heard a babe&#x2019;s squawk, I knew she had also brought her infant twin sons, who lay swaddled and tucked in a small cart she must have pulled over five miles of rutted paths from the Alexandria settlement.</p><p>As I leaned against the doorjamb, I watched her drop to her knees in front of my husband and beseech him to give her and the babes shelter. &#x201c;I will do anything to save them,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>They spoke in whispers and for a long moment she did not move before she slowly nodded and rose. When I saw him lean into her and raise his hand as if he wanted to touch her, I shouted, &#x201c;Witch! The good wives have banished you, Faith, from the settlement!&#x201d;</p><p>Faith didn&#x2019;t dare look in my direction, but I saw her fingers curl into fists. My husband didn&#x2019;t meet my gaze as he spoke in a low voice. She nodded again, never looking up. I realized a deal had been struck, and I was too late. The witch had spun her magic. My husband would allow her to stay.</p><p>She has cursed him, us, our lost children. Of that, I am sure. And I fear what evil Faith Shire will do now that she lives under our roof.</p><p>&#x2014;P</p><p></p><p></p><p>Chapter One</p><p>Rae McDonald</p><p>MONDAY, AUGUST 15, 9:00 A.M.</p><p>The headline glared on the page. <i>Rae McDonald: Matchmaker with a Heart of Stone?</i></p><p>When the reporter first reached out to me and explained she was doing a profile on successful businesswomen, I assumed her focus would center on my doctorate in psychology and my private family practice. The interview began well enough. I discussed my undergraduate work at Georgetown, graduate studies at the University of Virginia, and my thriving family practice. The reporter scribbled notes and appeared interested. Then she mentioned a friend of a friend who was a client of mine. &#x201c;Not a family practice client,&#x201d; she said, leaning forward with a grin. &#x201c;One of your matchmaking clients.&#x201d;</p><p>I am not a matchmaker. There are times when I make suggestions to couples, I explained, but I was not a matchmaker. Then, she detailed my high success rate and shared several glowing quotes from couples that had found happiness because of my marital advice. I supplied more statistics about my family practice, and she listened. Took notes. Nodded. And when she left my home, I assumed the matchmaking was a forgotten diversion.</p><p><i>Rae McDonald: A Matchmaker with a Heart of Stone?</i></p><p>People read the weekly Lifestyle edition of the paper, but also the online version, which had the potential to reach far beyond the limits of Old Town Alexandria to every corner of the world that had access to a computer. <i>Dr. McDonald, who sometimes appears to have a heart of stone, cuts through the emotional chaos of finding love to help her clients discover lasting happiness.</i></p><p>It felt like a tabloid expos�.</p><p><i>Heart of stone.</i></p><p>It didn&#x2019;t sit well. I wasn&#x2019;t the Tin Man looking for a heart. A robot. Mr. Spock. In fact, sadness nearly destroyed me when I was sixteen. My older sister had died, and I subsequently made reckless choices that resulted in a pregnancy. I carried a healthy baby boy to term, gave birth, and when he was hours old, laid him in another mother&#x2019;s arms forever. The loss and pain were crushing. Devastating. And on that day, I realized my very survival depended on suppressing all my feelings.</p><p>Heart of stone. Anyone with a heart of stone would never be forced to live with such a choice, because they lacked the capacity to feel. Such are the traits of sociopaths. And my pain had been very real until I exorcised it.</p><p>My detachment had served me well. I survived abandonment guilt, and I also thrived academically and professionally. My ability to keep feelings at bay is the reason I can navigate my clients&#x2019; emotional maelstroms. Because I remain detached from all their turmoil, my perspective is unencumbered and clear. I can see the forest for the trees.</p><p>As I stare out the window at the square, muddy patch of dirt in my backyard, raindrops roll lazily down hand-blown glass. The panes were original to the home, which was built over two hundred fifty years ago. I thought about the couple sitting behind me on the couch. They were here because of the article. They wanted a matchmaker to politely analyze and approve their union. They didn&#x2019;t need counseling. They wanted a rubber stamp on their rock-solid relationship.</p><p>Each had a clipboard, paper, pencil, and the charge to perform a simple exercise. <i>Write your deepest, darkest secret. Fold the paper in half and wait for my instruction.</i></p><p>These two individuals, like many of my clients, were successful in their own right. They were well on their way to enviable careers and shared high IQs, elite educations, drive, and ambition. But as valued as all those traits were on the corporate ladder, they didn&#x2019;t necessarily translate into thriving marriages.</p><p>Today, <i>He</i> was Samuel Morris: mid-thirties, a lawyer on track to be a partner in a Washington, D.C., law firm. He had a passion for great food and intended to have at least three children. <i>She</i> was Dr. Debra Osborne, a surgical resident at Georgetown Hospital who loved hiking, visiting Paris, and skiing. Though she spoke briefly of children, she neglected to check the box regarding children on my questionnaire.</p><p>In the first minutes of our initial interview today, they said that as soon as I gave my blessing on their match, they would formally announce their engagement. But this office wasn&#x2019;t a drive-up window, and I didn&#x2019;t give out gold stars unless they were earned.</p><p>Pencils scribbled, stopped, and scribbled again as I continued to stare out the window at the freshly graded square patch of land in my backyard.</p><p>This spot had once been the location of the original McDonald homestead hearth, which had long ago fallen into a tumble of moss-covered rubble, entwined with weeds and strawberry vines. It had stood on the property like a sentry since the Native Americans walked this land.</p><p>As legend had it, the stones were collected from the rivers and streams of Scotland to serve as ballast on merchant ships bound for the Virginia Colony. They were then loaded into the hull and placed around cargo so that in the event of a storm, the goods wouldn&#x2019;t shift, throwing the vessel off balance and sinking it. These stones arrived with the 1749 voyage of the ship <i>Discovery</i>, which also carried two newly married Scots, Patience and Michael McDonald. They&#x2019;d fled Scotland and a cholera epidemic to start afresh and tame the wild Virginia woods into profitable farmland.</p><p>According to my mother, <i>Discovery</i>&#x2019;s captain had been ready to dump the stones into the deep harbor at Hunting Creek and fill his hull with hogsheads of tobacco for the return voyage when my ancestor, never one to waste, offered to transport the stones ashore. The captain, anxious to anchor and see his wife, agreed. Michael McDonald and his wife offloaded the stones into a cart on shore and built the hearth that would be the centerpiece of their cottage. Those stones warmed two generations of McDonalds before lightning struck the hearth in 1783, sending loose cinders from it onto the cottage&#x2019;s thatched roof. Fire broke out and within minutes chewed through the roof, the rafters, and the home&#x2019;s contents.</p><p>The blackened stones were forgotten, and there they lay for over two centuries. Someone in each generation suggested that the stones be dismantled and hauled away, but there was always an elder at the ready to prevent their removal. The stones, the old ones said, warded off evil and protected the family. How many times had crops been spared from gale-force winds? When the Union troops marched through Virginia, why was the McDonald house left untouched? The stones protected the house and the land. But perhaps not its inhabitants.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t believe in talismans or curses, but if I did, I&#x2019;d note that the stones&#x2019; power was bogus. The McDonald farm, which had been reported to cover a thousand acres at one time, had dwindled to a one-acre lot. Generations of McDonalds died young, including my sister. And my son was gone. Complete bunk.</p><p>After my mother&#x2019;s passing two years ago, the stone sentry grew more and more unsightly and became an embarrassing reminder of superstition and outdated fears.</p><p>My contractor had finally cleared the land six weeks ago, but the angry patch of red clay still looked startlingly out of place each time I glimpsed at it. I still expected to see the stones. My gut was beginning to tell me I had made a grave mistake.</p><p>The near-monsoon rains prevented any new construction, and with each passing day, the bare soil looked more and more like a sunken grave. Whatever relief or sense of accomplishment I might have anticipated was sorely missing.</p><p>Turning from the window, I studied the couple. They each sat rigid, their hands gripping their papers. Body language spoke volumes. &#x201c;Have you finished?&#x201d;</p><p>Debra tugged her black skirt, sitting a little taller. She was petite, with dark brown hair and eyes that carried an intensity that was difficult to miss. She was the type who studied hard, made good grades, and played by the rules. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure of the purpose of this exercise.&#x201d;</p><p>Samuel raised a soft uncallused hand to his mouth and coughed. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t really make sense. You&#x2019;ve heard us talk for an hour today. Surely you must see we&#x2019;re nearly perfect for each other.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Exchange papers,&#x201d; I said, ignoring his comment.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Debra asked.</p><p>&#x201c;You tell Samuel your darkest secret, and he&#x2019;ll tell you his. If you love each other, then you should be able to know the worst and still find acceptance. Long-term relationships require that kind of trust.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither moved, and a heavy silence settled between them as they exchanged nervous glances until Samuel asked, &#x201c;What does the past have to do with now? Today is what matters.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The past isn&#x2019;t separate. It&#x2019;s part of us,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Debra glanced at Samuel, her grin uneasy. Neither budged. &#x201c;I have to agree with Samuel. We accept each other for who we are now. The past is over and done. Neither one of us wants to dredge up or catalogue yesterday&#x2019;s news.&#x201d;</p><p>A grandfather clock in the hallway chimed ten times, indicating our session was over. &#x201c;When you two can exchange papers, then call me for another session. Otherwise you&#x2019;re wasting your time and mine.&#x201d;</p><p>Samuel shoved his paper in his pocket. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t come here to create a problem where there is none. All we want is a confirmation that we&#x2019;re a good couple.&#x201d;</p><p>Arching a brow, I studied him, not with anger or frustration, but with mild interest. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;re looking for a yes or a no regarding your relationship, I would have to say, given the current conditions, that my answer would be no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Samuel asked. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s absurd.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would wager you&#x2019;ve done more due diligence on prospective corporate mergers than this marriage,&#x201d; I replied.</p><p><i>&#x201c;No?&#x201d;</i> Debra nearly shouted, glancing at Samuel. &#x201c;We paid one hundred and fifty dollars for a <i>no</i>?&#x201d;</p><p>Staring her down, I replied, &#x201c;You paid for my opinion. I&#x2019;ve given it.&#x201d;</p><p>Debra rose, straightening to her full five feet five inches. &#x201c;We get a lousy <i>no</i>, because we don&#x2019;t want to open the past? Our future does not earn a <i>no!</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t give you a patronizing yes. Past, present, and future are links in a chain. For a chain to hold, all the links must be strong. You can&#x2019;t simply pick and choose.&#x201d; I traced the face of the simple wristwatch nestled next to the pearls. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s also the fact that Debra didn&#x2019;t check the box for children on the questionnaire.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned a bit red-faced. &#x201c;I missed it. Give me the form and I&#x2019;ll check it now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not until you exchange pages.&#x201d; I looked at my watch. &#x201c;Now you must excuse me. I have another appointment.&#x201d;</p><p>Samuel stood, wrapping a protective arm around Debra. &#x201c;This was a waste of time. A waste of money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I disagree,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I have saved you the cost of an expensive wedding and a more expensive divorce. The one hundred and fifty dollars was well worth it to you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But we <i>love</i> each other,&#x201d; Debra said. &#x201c;That must count.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been dating three months,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;Yes, you have an affection, but what both of you are feeling is sexual attraction. It&#x2019;ll fade in less than a year. And then you&#x2019;ll be left with each other. If the foundation is not solid and the goals are not in alignment, the marriage won&#x2019;t survive.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is ridiculous,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The front doorbell chimed. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s my next appointment.&#x201d;</p><p>Samuel shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m telling everyone who&#x2019;ll listen that you&#x2019;re a fraud.&#x201d;</p><p>Slowly, I turned back toward him. As a family practice psychologist, I was accustomed to dealing with raw nerves, tears, and anger. This couple&#x2019;s determined need for my approval was the first red flag. Debra&#x2019;s worried expression and Samuel&#x2019;s ire were the next. My approval was an excuse for a deeper reason. &#x201c;Show Debra the paper in your pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>His eyes narrowed. He was now opposing counsel, and in his mind&#x2019;s eye, we were facing each other across the negotiating table. &#x201c;Fine. I will.&#x201d; He dug the crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket and handed it to Debra. &#x201c;Go ahead, rea...</p></p><h2>Masquerade</h2><p>1932 ffirst edition hardcover</p><p></p><h2>Moholy-Nagy: Photographs and Photograms</h2><p>Inspects the photographs and examines the innovations of the visionary Hungarian artist and photographer, paying attention to his impact on the Weimar Bauhaus, the Chicago School of Design, and artistic development during the 1920s and 1930s</p><p>Moholy-Nagy was born in Hungary in 1895.

Years earlier, Levi--a sergeant in the army--made a tragic choice that led his team into ambush, leaving three soldiers dead and two badly injured. During the attack, Levi risked death to save a badly burned and disfigured Nick. His actions won him the Silver Star for gallantry, but nothing could alleviate the guilt he carried after that fateful day. He may have saved Nick in Iraq, but when Levi returns home and spirals out of control, it is Nick's turn to play the savior, urging Levi to write. Levi begins to type as a way of bidding farewell, but what remains when he is finished is not a suicide note. It's a love song, a novel in which the beginning is the story's end, the story's end is the real beginning of Levi's life, and the future is as mutable as words on a page.</p><p>Matthew J.

In her life she reconciled aspects of spirituality often seen to be either mutually exclusive or in conflict. This married lay woman was both a mystic and a humanitarian, a constant contemplative, yet daily immersed in the physical care of the sick and the destitute. For the last five centuries she has been the inspiration of such spiritual greats as Francis de Sales, Robert Bellarmine, Fenelon, Newman and Hecker. Friedrich von H�gel&#39;s famous Mystical Element of Religion was a study of the spirituality of Catherine.

He lives in Colorado with his family.&nbsp;@TABarronAuthor<b>Rage and Ruin<br></b>&nbsp;<br> Narkazan&#x2019;s scream of rage erupted from his lair near the spirit realm&#x2019;s Caverns of Doom. The scream was so loud&#x2014;and so malicious&#x2014;that it shattered several enormous icicles hanging from the frozen cloud that hid his lair. Of the icicles that remained intact, many turned a vengeful shade of crimson; others started to drip not water&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but blood.<br>&nbsp;<br> His face, narrow as an ax blade, scowled at the pair of mistwraiths who hovered before him. He shook his head, making his battered black earring clink ominously against one of his tusks. As red as those tusks were, they paled next to the fiery centers of his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Escape!&#x201d; he snarled. &#x201c;You allowed that miserable, meddling son of Sammelvar to break in here&#x2014;and then escape!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The mistwraiths trembled fearfully, their forms quaking like shadows within shadows. That was highly unusual, since normally it was the role of the mistwraiths to make everyone else quake with fright. Everyone, that is, except their brutal master, Narkazan. He knew exactly how to punish them with excruciating pain&#x2014;and, if he chose, to eliminate them completely.<br>&nbsp;<br> As the warrior spirit glared at them, both mistwraiths crackled with black sparks. Hovering just above the floor like living blots of darkness, they slid slowly backward until they pressed against the vaporstone wall of the lair. For a long moment, they remained there, held by Narkazan&#x2019;s gaze.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He even killed one of your company&#x2014;how, I cannot imagine,&#x201d; Narkazan rasped angrily. &#x201c;Not only that. He freed my prisoner, his sister the Seer.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> He waved a bony hand at the empty room that had served as Jaladay&#x2019;s prison cell. &#x201c;Her skill at seeing the future would have proved useful in the coming battles.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> A low growl came from his throat, echoing in the chamber. &#x201c;Worst of all, he made off with my scrolls&#x2014;my battle plans! How,&#x201d; Narkazan demanded, &#x201c;am I supposed to conduct my War of Glory with those detailed plans now in the hands of my sworn enemy?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Bravely, one of the mistwraiths slid forward, spraying black sparks on the floor. Though it still trembled with fright, it managed to make a sound that combined harsh crackling and strangled gurgling.<br>&nbsp;<br> Clearly surprised, Narkazan listened intently. Then, in a much quieter voice, he said, &#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re right. How could I expect you to have stopped him when you weren&#x2019;t even here when he broke in?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The mistwraith sighed with a shower of sparks. It trembled a little less.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;After all,&#x201d; continued the warlord softly, &#x201c;you can&#x2019;t be expected to be everywhere at once.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Turning a shade less dark, the mistwraith ceased trembling altogether.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Except,&#x201d; added Narkazan, his eyes suddenly flashing with rage, &#x201c;it was your job to protect this place!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> As Narkazan shouted those words, the mistwraith screeched loudly and started to back away again. But before it could join its companion against the wall, the warlord snapped his wrist and hurled a bolt of black lightning. The mistwraith screeched in utter agony, exploded with a spray of sparks, and vanished completely.<br>&nbsp;<br> All that remained of the dark being were a few last sparks. They quivered, sizzling on the floor. Then they, too, disappeared.<br>&nbsp;<br> Fixing his gaze on the surviving mistwraith, Narkazan watched it shudder with terror. Finally, he spoke again in the quiet tone that was his most dangerous.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Never, never, never fail me. Or your fate will be the same.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The mistwraith crackled fearfully. Black sparks charred the vaporstone wall.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Good. Now heed this new command.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Still trembling, the mistwraith did its best to stand at attention.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Call all the mistwraiths together. Tell them they must divide into two groups&#x2014;and complete two essential tasks. One group must find that cursed Promi, the son of Sammelvar who bears the mark of the Prophecy on his chest. Yes, find him and bring him to me!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The growl returned. &#x201c;I want him alive, do you understand? Not reduced to ashes as you mistwraiths are so fond of doing. No, I want him to suffer through every pain, every torture, I can possibly devise&#x2014;until he willingly gives up his spirit life forever.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Crackling in assent, the mistwraith bowed.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And watch out for that buffoon Grukarr, who claims to serve me but keeps botching his tasks. If he ever gets in your way&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;&#x2014;he paused to snap his fingers&#x2014;&#x201c;destroy him.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The mistwraith gave another bow.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The other group,&#x201d; rasped Narkazan, &#x201c;must go to that mortal wasteland Earth. Worry not about the veil, for my scouts have confirmed that it can no longer impede us, no matter how large the force. Somewhere down there is the one thing I want most, the most powerful object in any realm.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> He clenched his jaw, hissing as he exhaled through his teeth. &#x201c;The Starstone. It is hidden on what mortals call Atlantis&#x2014;the island with so much magic of its own that it conceals the magic of that treasure. Atlantis will be the very first place on Earth I will invade&#x2014;to take all its natural magic for my own uses. But first I need you to find the Starstone and bring it straight to me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Glowering at the mistwraith, Narkazan added, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t take more than six of your number, for any more than that will trigger the island&#x2019;s power to repel invasions&#x2014;another of Sammelvar&#x2019;s old curses. But six of you should be more than enough to overpower any foes and find that crystal.&#x201d;<br> Impatiently, he tapped one of his tusks. &#x201c;That wretched Promi robbed me once of the chance to turn the Starstone into a weapon&#x2014;the most destructive one in the universe. He will not do so again!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Through gritted teeth, the warrior spirit vowed, &#x201c;And with the corrupted Starstone&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I shall triumph over all.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Bowing again, the mistwraith crackled eagerly.<br>&nbsp;<br> With a grim nod, Narkazan announced, &#x201c;While you warriors do your work, I shall do mine. I will turn my thoughts to two of my servants already in the mortal world. First of all&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that sea captain turned machinist, Reocoles, will soon have another dream. A truly memorable dream.&#x201d;<br> He rubbed his pointed chin. &#x201c;And second, from deep in that rancid pool on Earth&#x2019;s newest island, that place called Atlantis&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a being will emerge. A monster filled with deep hunger. Yes&#x2014;the kind of hunger that can be satisfied only by death and destruction.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> In a raspy whisper, he added, &#x201c;And that monster will carry with it something else&#x2014;something that will make my ultimate conquest of the Earth much easier. Once that is done&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. nothing can stop me from seizing the rest of the universe.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The scars on his face darkened. &#x201c;That monster could serve another purpose, as well. That fool Promi cares far too much for mortals, proof of his weakness. And the monster from the pool might just bring him out of hiding.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> The mistwraith trembled excitedly.<br>&nbsp;<br> Narkazan strode over to the metal chest beside his cot, the spot where he&#x2019;d kept the precious scrolls with his battle plans. And then, for the first time in a long while, the malevolent warrior smiled. Though it looked more like a predator baring his teeth, it was for him a real sign of pleasure.<br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Now I know,&#x201d; he said aloud, &#x201c;what to do about those wasted plans.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> He nodded with confidence. &#x201c;If this new idea works&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it will ensure my victory.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Turning back to the mistwraith, he barked, &#x201c;Now go!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br> Instantly, the shadowy being zipped across the chamber and through the doorway.</p><h2>Killing Fields Living Fields: Faith in Cambodia (Biography)</h2><p><p>The Cambodian Church was first planted among the rice farmers of North-West Cambodia in the mid-1920s.

Rather than speculate about what prompted so and so to give $25,000, or $100,000 or $1,000,000, Panas rang them up and said, Can I come talk with you? Admittedly, that is easy for Panas who knows practically everyone save Benedict XVI. Panas winnowed his questions down to the most revealing: what prompts you to give, what about the person soliciting you is important, what do you look for in an organization, what immediately turns you off, to what extent do the board and CEO matter to you, how does an organization keep you giving, and a handful of others. The donors are surprisingly candid, which makes Mega Gifts a bit naughty, and what they say will unquestionably alter your approach to major gifts. And do not depair if you are aiming to solicit the Pope. Panas recently dined with the Archbishop of Canterbury, so he is clearly working his way up.</p><p>� ONLY BOOK OF ITS KIND <p>No other book on the market plumbs the psychology of giving as Mega Gifts does. Jerold Panas, hailed by Newsweek as "the Robert Schuller of Fundraising," explores the motives and pressures that drive men and women to make gifts of consequential size. </p><p>Scores of books dwell on the techniques for soliciting donors, but only Mega Gifts focuses on the human dimension of giving &#x2013; questioning the donors themselves to uncover their underlying motivations. </p><p>� NOTABLE INTERVIEWEES </p><p>For his research, Panas interviewed dozens of notable philanthropists, each of whom has given million-dollar gifts (some many times over).

She took enormous interest in all his excavations, and when friends asked what her strange life was like, she decided to answer their questions in this delightful book. First published in 1946, Come, Tell Me How You Live is now reissued in B format. It gives a charming picture of Agatha Christie herself, and is, as Jacquetta Hawkes concludes in her Introduction, &#39;a pure pleasure to read&#39;.</p><p>Agatha Christie was already a celebrated writer of mysteries when, in 1930, she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan. In the pre&#x2013;war years thereafter, Christie enthusiastically joined her husband on various archaeological expeditions in the Middle East, and these shared adventures, these happy and memorable times, provided her not only with the background for several of her novels, but also with the &#x201c;everyday doings and happenings&#x201d; which she zestfully describes in the pages of this high&#x2013;spirited memoir, which was first published in 1946. New Introduction by David Pryce-Jones.<p>To the world she was Agatha Christie, author of numerous bestselling mysteries and whodunits, arguably the most popular writer in the English language. But in the 1930s she wore a different hat, traveling with her husband, renowned archaeologist Max Mallowan, as he investigated the buried ruins and ancient wonders of Syria and Iraq. Described by the author as a "meandering chronicle of life on an archaeological dig," <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em> is Dame Agatha Christie's first-person account of her time spent in this breathtaking corner of the globe where recorded human history began. It is a fascinating, eye-opening, vibrant, and vivid portrait of a place, a people, and a past, by a legendary writer whose extraordinary popularity endures to this day; an altogether remarkable narrative of everyday life in a world now long since vanished.</p></p><h2>The Copper Beech</h2><p>In the Irish town of Schancarrig, the young people carve their initials-and those of their loves&#x2014;into the copper beech tree in front of the schoolhouse. But not even Father Gunn, the parish priest, who knows most of what goes on behind Shancarrig's closed doors, or Dr. Jims, the village doctor, who knows all the rest, realizes that not everything in the placid village is what it seems. <br><br>Unexpected passions and fear are bringing together the lives of so many, such as the sensitive new priest and Miss Ross, the slight, beautiful schoolteacher... Leonora, the privileged daughter of the town's richest family and Foxy Dunne, whose father did time in jail...and Nessa Ryan, whose parents run Ryan's Hotel, and two very different young men.

One man stands in their way. An off-duty SAS soldier is hiding somewhere inside the train. Alone and injured, he's the only chance the passengers and crew have of getting out alive.

Based on 200 extensive interviews with middle-class Americans, Wolfe's study uncovers a striking tolerance. Americans, according to the author, can be quite harsh when judging their own behavior, but they exhibit a hands-off approach with others. (Wolfe also cites an exception to this rule: homosexuality.) Americans are not torn apart by any kind of cultural war, contrary to the claims of intellectuals on both the right and left. Instead, writes Wolfe, they are a practical people willing to accept social change. Forget the shallow opinion polls that appear every few days in the news. <i>One Nation, After All</i> comes closer to the real pulse of the American people than just about any other you will find.Sociologist (Boston Univ.) and social critic par excellence, Wolfe (Marginalized in the Middle, not reviewed, etc.) scores again with this thorough, edifying, and engrossing study of the fabled but elusive American middle class. Based on his Middle Class Morality Project, a group of 200 interviews conducted by Wolfe himself in eight middle-class suburbs of four citiesAtlanta (DeKalb and Cobb counties), Boston (Brookline and Medford), San Diego (Eastlake and Rancho Bernardo), and Tulsa (Broken Arrow and Sand Springs)this intimate study is a smooth read. Wolfe is master of his material, and his easy, levelheaded style keeps you reading to the end, even if only to hear the ``silent majority's'' thoughtful answers to his pointed questions about religion (``quiet faith'' is the rule), welfare (good in principle, but poorly executed), racism (``Whites are against affirmative action, blacks tend to be for it, and Hispanics are split down the middle''), patriotism (robust, but skeptical), and family (``let people make those decisions that best fit themselves''). Wolfe's bottom line is that ``there are strong divisions in middle-class America . . . people in Brookline clearly do not think the same way as people in Tulsa.'' He grants, therefore, that America is experiencing a culture war, but ``one that is being fought primarily by intellectuals, not by most Americans themselves.'' Americans are far less polarized politically than pundits would have us believe, and lean instead, toward a ``sensible center,'' where compromise and tolerance guide public life. Americans share a strong libertarian streak, or as Wolfe couches it, ``respect for moral freedom and nonjudgmentalism cut so deep'' among middle-class Americans that they are willing to accept even the things they disapprove of most strongly (e.g., homosexuality, one of the most widely reviled). Wolfe's round-up is an absolute must for anyone who wants or, in every politician's case, needs to know how Americans think. (Author tour) -- <i>Copyright �1998, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Using classical Jewish sources as well as supplementary material from history, anthropology, sociology, psychology, ancient religion, and feminist theory, Judith Antonelli has examined in detail every woman and every issue pertaining to women in the Torah, parshah by parshah. The Torah is divided into fifty-four portions; each portion, or parshah, is read in the synagogue on the Sabbath (combining a few to make a yearly cycle of readings). This book is modeled on that structure; hence there are fifty chapters, each of which corresponds to a parshah. One may, therefore, read this book from beginning to end or use it as a study guide for the parshah of the week. The reader will discover in these pages that the Torah is not the root of misogyny, sexism, or male supremacy. Rather, by looking at the Torah in the context in which it was given, the pagan world of the ancient Near East, it becomes clear that far from oppressing women, the Torah actually improved the status of women as it existed in the surrounding societies. Not only does this book refute the common feminist stereotype that Judaism is a &#39;patriarchal religion&#39; but it also refutes the sexism found in Judaism by exposing it as sociological rather than &#39;divine law.&#39;</p><p>In the Image of God: A Feminist Commentary on the Torah is a unique blend of traditional Judaism and radical feminism.

Ajany had once believed Baba was omnipotent, like God, ever since he had invoked a black leopard to hunt down the mean and red-eyed inhabit- ants of her nightmares.<br> She trembles. <br> Nyipir asks, &#x201c;Cold?&#x201d;<br> Baba&#x2019;s baritone, Odidi&#x2019;s echo. Dimpled handsomeness. The Oganda men were gifted with soft-edged, rumbling voices. <br> Ajany turns. The light of the sky bounces on her thin face, all<br> bones and angles. Fresh bloodstains on her sleeves. The frills of her orange skirt are soiled. She is tinier than Nyipir remembers. But she had always been such a small, stuttering thing, all big hair and large eyes. More shadow than person, head slanted as if waiting for answers to ancient riddles. He clears his throat. From the gloom of his soul, Nyipir growls, &#x201c;Mama . . . er . . . she wanted to . . . uh . . . come to meet you.&#x201d;<br> Ajany hears the lie. Sucks it in, as if it were venom, sketches invis- ible circles on the window. Stares at the green of coffee and pineapple plantations below.<br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Nyipir says to himself, already lost, already afraid. He shifts. The dying had started long ago. Long before the murder of prophets named Pio, Tom, Argwings, Ronald, Kungu, Josiah, Ouko, Mbae. The others, the &#x201c;disappeared unknown.&#x201d; National doors slammed over vaults of secrets. Soon the wise chose cowardice, a way of life: not hearing, not seeing, never asking, because sound, like dreams, could cause death. Sound gave up names, especially those of friends. It co-opted silence as an eavesdropper; casual conversations heard were delivered to the state to murder. In time neighborhood kai-apple fences were urged into thicker and higher growth to shut out the dread-filled nation. But some of the lost, the unseen and unheard, cut tracks into Nyipir&#x2019;s sleep. They stared at him in silence until the day his disordered dreams stepped into daylight with him to become his life:<br> They had pointed a gun to his head. <br> Click, click, click.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had fallen to the ground, slithered on his belly like a snake, hissed, and vomited, because he had forgotten how to talk.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today. <br> Sweat on palms, heartbeat quickening, Nyipir swallows. A groan.<br> Ajany hears a father&#x2019;s leaching anguish. She scratches an ache where it itches her skin, gropes inside-places as a tongue probing cavities does. Expecting to be stung.<br> &nbsp;<br> Today. <br> The past&#x2019;s beckon is persistent. <br> From the air, Nyipir peers down at an expanding abyss. His country, his home, is ripping itself apart. Stillborn ballot revolution. These 2007 elections were supposed to be simple, the next small jump into a light-filled Kenyan future. Everything had instead disintegrated into a single, unending howl by the nation&#x2019;s unrequited dead. This country, this haunted ideal, all its poor, broken promises. Nyipir watches, arm- pits damp. A view of ground-lit smoke. Dry lips. His people had never set their nation on fire before.<br> On the ground, that night, in a furtive ceremony, beneath a half- moon, a chubby man will mutter an oath that will render him the presi- dent of a burning, dying country. The deed will add fuel to an already out-of-control national grieving.<br> Nyipir turns from the window. <br> He is flying home with his children. <br> Yet he is alone. Memories are solitary ghosts. <br> He lets them in, traveling with them.</p><h2>Dream on: Livin&#39; on the Edge with Steven Tyler and Aerosmith (Berkley Boulevard Celebrity Biography)</h2><p>The rock musician&#39;s former wife reveals her experiences with the singer in a memoir full of sexual excess, drugs, love, and abuse.</p><p><p>Cyrinda Foxe was born in Santa Monica, California, but ran away from home, eventually landing in New York City.

At the heart of this epic saga is a vast ship, the Ibis. Its destiny is a tumultuous voyage across the Indian Ocean to the Mauritius Islands. As to the people on board, they are a motley array of sailors and stowaways, coolies and convicts. In a time of colonial upheaval in the mid-nineteenth century, fate has thrown together a truly diverse cast of Indians and Westerners, from a bankrupt Raja to a widowed village-woman, from a mulatto American freedman to a free-spirited European orphan. As they sail down the Hooghly and into the sea, their old family ties are washed away, and they view themselves as jahaj-bhais, or ship-brothers, who will build whole new lives for themselves in the remote islands where they are being taken. It is the beginning of an unlikely dynasty.</p><p>Amitav Ghosh is the internationally bestselling author of many works of fiction and non-fiction, including the novel The Glass Palace, and the recipient of numerous prizes and awards. He divides his time between Kolkata and Goa, India, and Brooklyn, New York.<p>One</p><p>The vision of a tall-masted ship, at sail on the ocean, came to Deeti on an otherwise ordinary day, but she knew instantly that the apparition was a sign of destiny, for she had never seen such a vessel before, not even in a dream: how could she have, living as she did in northern Bihar, four hundred miles from the coast? Her village was so far inland that the sea seemed as distant as the netherworld: it was the chasm of darkness where the holy Ganga disappeared into the Kala-Pani, &#x2018;the Black Water&#x2019;.</p><p>It happened at the end of winter, in a year when the poppies were strangely slow to shed their petals: for mile after mile, from Benares onwards, the Ganga seemed to be flowing between twin glaciers, both its banks being blanketed by thick drifts of white-petalled flowers. It was as if the snows of the high Himalayas had descended on the plains to await the arrival of Holi and its springtime profusion of colour.</p><p>The village in which Deeti lived was on the outskirts of the town of Ghazipur, some fifty miles east of Benares. Like all her neighbours, Deeti was preoccupied with the lateness of her poppy crop: that day, she rose early and went through the motions of her daily routine, laying out a freshly washed dhoti and kameez for Hukam Singh, her husband, and preparing the rotis and achar he would eat at midday. Once his meal had been wrapped and packed, she broke off to pay a quick visit to her shrine room: later, after she&#x2019;d bathed and changed, Deeti would do a proper puja, with flowers and offerings; now, being clothed still in her night-time sari, she merely stopped at the door, to join her hands in a brief genuflection.</p><p>Soon a squeaking wheel announced the arrival of the ox-cart that would take Hukam Singh to the factory where he worked, in Ghazipur, three miles away. Although not far, the distance was too great for Hukam Singh to cover on foot, for he had been wounded in the leg while serving as a sepoy in a British regiment. The disability was not so severe as to require crutches, however, and Hukam Singh was able to make his way to the cart without assistance. Deeti followed a step behind, carrying his food and water, handing the cloth-wrapped package to him after he had climbed in.</p><p>Kalua, the driver of the ox-cart, was a giant of a man, but he made no move to help his passenger and was careful to keep his face hidden from him: he was of the leather-workers&#x2019; caste and Hukam Singh, as a high-caste Rajput, believed that the sight of his face would bode ill for the day ahead. Now, on climbing into the back of the cart, the former sepoy sat facing to the rear, with his bundle balanced on his lap, to prevent its coming into direct contact with any of the driver&#x2019;s belongings. Thus they would sit, driver and passenger, as the cart creaked along the road to Ghazipur&#x2014;conversing amicably enough, but never exchanging glances.</p><p>Deeti, too, was careful to keep her face covered in the driver&#x2019;s presence: it was only when she went back inside, to wake Kabutri, her six-year-old daughter, that she allowed the ghungta of her sari to slip off her head. Kabutri was lying curled on her mat and Deeti knew, because of her quickly changing pouts and smiles, that she was deep in a dream: she was about to rouse her when she stopped her hand and stepped back. In her daughter&#x2019;s sleeping face, she could see the lineaments of her own likeness&#x2014;the same full lips, rounded nose and upturned chin&#x2014;except that in the child the lines were still clean and sharply drawn, whereas in herself they had grown smudged and indistinct. After seven years of marriage, Deeti was not much more than a child herself, but a few tendrils of white had already appeared in her thick black hair. The skin of her face, parched and darkened by the sun, had begun to flake and crack around the corners of her mouth and her eyes. Yet, despite the careworn commonplaceness of her appearance, there was one respect in which she stood out from the ordinary: she had light grey eyes, a feature that was unusual in that part of the country. Such was the colour&#x2014;or perhaps colourlessness&#x2014;of her eyes that they made her seem at once blind and all-seeing. This had the effect of unnerving the young, and of reinforcing their prejudices and superstitions to the point where they would sometimes shout taunts at her&#x2014;chudaliya, dainiya&#x2014;as if she were a witch: but Deeti had only to turn her eyes on them to make them scatter and run off. Although not above taking a little pleasure in her powers of discomfiture, Deeti was glad, for her daughter&#x2019;s sake, that this was one aspect of her appearance that she had not passed on&#x2014;she delighted in Kabutri&#x2019;s dark eyes, which were as black as her shiny hair. Now, looking down on her daughter&#x2019;s dreaming face, Deeti smiled and decided that she wouldn&#x2019;t wake her after all: in three or four years the girl would be married and gone; there would be enough time for her to work when she was received into her husband&#x2019;s house; in her few remaining years at home she might as well rest.</p><p>With scarcely a pause for a mouthful of roti, Deeti stepped outside, on to the flat threshold of beaten earth that divided the mud-walled dwelling from the poppy fields beyond. By the light of the newly risen sun, she saw, greatly to her relief, that some of her flowers had at last begun to shed their petals. On the adjacent field, her husband&#x2019;s younger brother, Chandan Singh, was already out with his eight-bladed nukha in hand. He was using the tool&#x2019;s tiny teeth to make notches on some of the bare pods&#x2014;if the sap flowed freely overnight he would bring his family out tomorrow, to tap the field. The timing had to be exactly right because the priceless sap flowed only for a brief period in the plant&#x2019;s span of life: a day or two this way or that, and the pods were of no more value than the blossoms of a weed.</p><p>Chandan Singh had seen her too and he was not a person who could let anyone pass by in silence. A slack-jawed youth with a brood of five children of his own, he never missed an opportunity to remind Deeti of her paucity of offspring. Ka bha�l? he called out, licking a drop of fresh sap from the tip of his instrument. What&#x2019;s the matter? Working alone again? How long can you carry on like this? You need a son, to give you a helping hand. You&#x2019;re not barren, after all . . .</p><p>Being accustomed to her brother-in-law&#x2019;s ways, Deeti had no difficulty in ignoring his jibes: turning her back on him, she headed into her own field, carrying a wide wicker basket at her waist. Between the rows of flowers, the ground was carpeted in papery petals and she scooped them up in handfuls, dropping them into her basket. A week or two before, she would have taken care to creep sideways, so as not to disturb the flowers, but today she all but flounced as she went and was none too sorry when her swishing sari swept clusters of petals off the ripening pods. When the basket was full, she carried it back and emptied it next to the outdoor chula where she did most of her cooking. This part of the threshold was shaded by two enormous mango trees, which had just begun to sprout the dimples that would grow into the first buds of spring. Relieved to be out of the sun, Deeti squatted beside her oven and thrust an armload of firewood into last night&#x2019;s embers, which could still be seen glowing, deep inside the ashes.</p><p>Kabutri was awake now, and when she showed her face in the doorway, her mother was no longer in a mood to be indulgent. So late? she snapped. Where were you? K�m-o-k�j na hoi? You think there&#x2019;s no work to be done?</p><p>Deeti gave her daughter the job of sweeping the poppy petals into a heap while she busied herself in stoking the fire and heating a heavy iron tawa. Once this griddle was heated through, she sprinkled a handful of petals on it and pressed them down with a bundled-up rag. Darkening as they toasted, the petals began to cling together so that in a minute or two they looked exactly like the round wheat-flour rotis Deeti had packed for her husband&#x2019;s midday meal. And &#x2018;roti&#x2019; was indeed the name by which these poppy-petal wrappers were known although their purpose was entirely different from that of their namesake: they were to be sold to the Sudder Opium Factory, in Ghazipur, where they would be used to line the earthenware containers in which opium was packed.</p><p>Kabutri, in the meanwhile, had kneaded some atta and rolled out a few real rotis. Deeti cooked them quickly, before poking out the fire: the rotis were put aside, to be eaten later with yesterday&#x2019;s leftovers&#x2014;a dish of stale alu-posth, potatoes cooked in poppy-seed paste. Now, her mind turned to her shrine room again: with the hour of the noontime puja drawing close, it was time to go down to the river for a bath. After massaging poppy-seed oil into Kabutri&#x2019;s hair and her own, Deeti draped her spare sari over her shoulder and led her daughter towards the water, across the field.</p><p>The poppies ended at a sandbank that sloped gently down to the Ganga; warmed by the sun, the sand was hot enough to sting the soles of their bare feet. The burden of motherly decorum slipped suddenly off Deeti&#x2019;s bowed shoulders and she began to run after her daughter, who had skipped on ahead. A pace or two from the water&#x2019;s edge, they shouted an invocation to the river&#x2014;Jai Ganga Mayya ki . . . &#x2014;and gulped down a draught of air, before throwing themselves in.</p><p>They were both laughing when they came up again: it was the time of year when, after the initial shock of contact, the water soon reveals itself to be refreshingly cool. Although the full heat of summer was still several weeks away, the flow of the Ganga had already begun to dwindle. Turning in the direction of Benares, in the west, Deeti hoisted her daughter aloft, to pour out a handful of water as a tribute to the holy city. Along with the offering, a leaf flowed out of the child&#x2019;s cupped palms. They turned t...</p></p><h2>Fabric Embellishing: The Basics &amp; Beyond: Over 50 Techniques (Landauer) How-To &amp; Tips for Soft &amp; Hard Embellishments and Creating a Personal Workbook, plus a Designer's Gallery of Embellished Projects</h2><p><p><b>Embellishing your fabric with flair is more fun than ever, thanks to this fabulous guide!</b></p><ul><li><b>Over 50 embellishing techniques</b> with step-by-step how-to photos and instructions</li><li><b>300 photos</b> walk you through every technique and provide inspirational examples in a Designer's Gallery</li><li><b>Step-by-step instructions</b> and tips throughout each chapter show you how to create with new techniques</li><li><b>Fabric manipulation</b> techniques include weaving, dyeing, and photo transfers onto fabric</li><li><b>Soft embellishments</b> include appliqu�, needle feting, and machine &amp; hand stitching methods</li><li><b>Hard embellishments</b> include beading, sequins, silk cocoons, and edge burning</li><li><b>Create a fabric workbook</b> with dozens of workbook pages and step-by-step instructions to construct your own</li></ul><p></p><p>Inside <i>Fabric Embellishing: The Basics and Beyond</i>, you'll discover, learn, combine, and enjoy over 50 exciting embellishing techniques that will enhance and personalize any fabric project.</p><p>Starting with the essentials, the authors cover equipment and supplies.

Written withwit and aplomb, this page turner will instigate an insurrection against ourmarital complacency.&#x201d; &#x2014;Esther Perel,&nbsp;author of <em>Matingin Captivity</em></p><p>Writtenwith the persuasive power of Naomi Wolf and the analytical skills of Susan Faludi, Pamela Haag&#x2019;s provocative but sympathetic look atthe state of marriage today answers&#x2014;and goes beyond&#x2014;the question many of us are asking: "Is this all there is?"</p></p><p><p>Pamela Haag has written <em>the</em> generational "big book" on modern marriage, a mesmerizing, sometimes salacious look at the semi-happy ambivalence lurking just below the surface of many marriages today. The spouses may rarely fight&#x2014;they may maintain a sincere affection for each other&#x2014;but one or both may harbor a melancholy sense that something important is missing. </p><p>Remarkably, this side of the marriage story hasn't been told or analyzed&#x2014;until now.</p><p>Meticulously researched and injected with insightful firsthand accounts and welcome doses of humor, <em>Marriage Confidential</em> articulates for a generation that grew up believing they would "have it all" why they have ended up disenchanted. Haag introduces us to contemporary marriages where spouses act more like life partners than lovers; children occupy an uncontested position at the center of the marital relationship; and even the romantic staples of sexual fidelity and passion are assailed from all sides&#x2014;so much so that spouses can end up having affairs online almost by accident.</p><p>Blending tales from the front lines of matrimony with cultural history, surveys, and research covert-ops (such as joining an online affair-finding site and posting a personal ad in the <em>New York Review of Books</em>), Haag paints a detailed picture of the state of marriage today. And to show what's possible as well as what's melancholy in our post-romantic age, Haag seeks out marriages with a twist&#x2014;rebels who are quietly brainstorming and evolving the scripts around career, money, social life, child rearing, and sex.</p><p>Provocative but sympathetic, forward-thinking and bold, here, at last, is a manifesto for living large in marriage.</p><p><strong>PAMELA HAAG</strong> has a Ph.D. in history from Yale and has held several fellowships.

They have fed our imagination for over two and a half millennia, inspiring everyone from Plato to Virgil, Pope to Joyce, Dante to Wolfgang Petersen. In this graceful and sweeping addition to the Books that Change the World Series, Alberto Manguel traces the lineage of the epic poems. He considers their original purpose, either as allegory or record of history, surveys the challenges the pagan poems presented to the early Christian world, and traces their spread after the Reformation. Following Homer through the greatest literature ever created, Manguel&#x2019;s book above all delights in the poems themselves, the primordial spring without which there would have been no culture.&#x201d;</p><p>Alberto Manguel is the bestselling author of several award-winning books, including A Dictionary of Imaginary Places and A History of Reading.Alberto Manguel's meticulous appreciation of Homer starts before the bard's epics were written and continues to the present. He discusses Homer's influence on a range of cultures and writers, down to the level of single metaphorical phrases. This sounds exhausting, but his love for his subject keeps it hypnotic, and Michael Prichard's delivery captures that emotional investment. Prichard evokes Homer's majesty as he reads the verse, and Manguel's admiration for the poet as well. A number of selections in the original Greek are included, as well as numerous translations and passages in other languages. Prichard declaims them all with a strong feel for cadence. He knows how to shift from a line describing intense violence to a scholarly gloss on the line without losing his listeners.

As the daughter of a socially prominent man, she also offered her husband, a poor yet gifted student, the opportunity to become an important religious leader.</p><p>Over the next decades Yetemegnu would endure extraordinary trials: the death of some of her children; her husband&#x2019;s imprisonment; and the detention of one of her sons. She witnessed the Fascist invasion of Ethiopia and the subsequent resistance, suffered Allied bombardment and exile from her city; lived through a bloody revolution and the nationalization of her land. She gained audiences with Emperor Haile Selassie I to argue for justice for her husband, for revenge, and for her children&#x2019;s security, and fought court battles to defend her assets against powerful men. But sustained, in part, by her fierce belief in the Virgin Mary and in Orthodox Christianity, Yetemegnu survived.

He glanced back at the Wake County Sheriff&#x2019;s Department police cruiser blocking the driveway, orange and blue lights silently rotating.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yo!&#x201d; Nick called into the house. &#x201c;Coming in!&#x201d;<br> <br>A fresh-faced sheriff&#x2019;s deputy in khaki short sleeves poked his head around the corner and beckoned him in. Nick wondered where they got these kids. He looked younger than some of his students.<br> <br>Nick stepped into the entryway. Dining room on the right, living room on the left. It was a typical suburban Raleigh home, a colonial five-four-and-a-door with white siding and black shutters. A mahogany bureau stood just inside the door. At its base lay three pair of shoes, one a pair of black patent leathers. Nick shook his head.<br> <br>He knew the layout by heart: stairway on the left, powder room on the right, down a short hallway was the kitchen, and the family room beyond that.<br> <br>Nick paused in the second doorway and took a moment to study the young officer. He stood nervously, awkwardly, constantly checking his watch. His right hand held a handkerchief cupped over his nose and mouth, and he winced as he sucked in each short gulp of air. Nick followed the officer&#x2019;s frozen gaze to the right; the decomposing body of a middle-aged woman lay sprawled across the white Formica island in the center of the kitchen.<br> <br>Nick knocked again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Officer ... Donnelly, is it? I&#x2019;m Dr. Nick Polchak. Are you the first one here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just a few blocks away, so I took the call.&#x201d; He glanced again at his watch. &#x201c;Our homicide people ought to be along within the hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick began to stretch on a pair of latex gloves and stepped around to the victim&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;The name on the mailbox said &#x2018;Allen.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Stephanie Allen. That&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;ve been able to get so far.&#x201d; The deputy nodded silently toward the family room, where a solitary figure sat slumped forward in a red leather chair with his face buried in his hands. Nick raised his own left hand and wiggled his ring finger. The deputy nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get your name&#x2014;did you say Kolchek?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Polchak. Nick Polchak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t sound like you&#x2019;re from around these parts.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m from Pittsburgh,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;d say you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br> <br>The deputy grinned. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You left your shoes at the door.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t do that in Pittsburgh? I guess they don&#x2019;t have the red clay.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The police don&#x2019;t do that in Pittsburgh. They figure if you&#x2019;ve got a dead body in the kitchen, you&#x2019;ve got more to worry about than dirty carpets.&#x201d;<br> <br>The body lay faceup, stretched out diagonally across the island under the bright kitchen fluorescents.<br> <br>&#x201c;Very handy,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;Too bad I don&#x2019;t find them all like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>The head rested in one corner, with medium-length blond hair flowing out evenly on all sides. There were deep abrasions and contusions on the neck and lower jaw. The body was in putrefaction, the second major stage of decomposition. The skin was blistered and tight from expanding gases, and the stench was considerable. There were sizable maggot infestations in both eye sockets and in the gaping mouth cavity. She had been dead for several days&#x2014;maybe a week or more.<br> <br>&#x201c;You got here fast, Doc. I thought the medical examiner&#x2019;s office was in Chapel Hill.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick shook his head. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t come from Chapel Hill. I came from NC State. I picked up your call on my police scanner.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;From the university? What were you doing there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where I work.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick removed a pair of slender forceps and a small magnifier from his coat pocket. He bent close to the victim&#x2019;s head and began to carefully sort through the wriggling mass of maggots in the left eye socket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait a minute. You&#x2019;re not from the medical examiner&#x2019;s office?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never said I was.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then who in the&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a member of the faculty at NC State. I&#x2019;m a professor in the department of entomology.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A professor of what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a forensic entomologist, Deputy. I study the way different necrophilous arthropods inhabit a body during the process of decomposition.&#x201d;<br> <br>The deputy stood speechless.<br> <br>Nick plucked a single plump, white larva from the wiggling mass and held it under the magnifier. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the Bug Man.&#x201d;<br> <br>The deputy began to blink rapidly. &#x201c;Now just hold on ... you&#x2019;re not supposed to ... you&#x2019;re not a part of this ...&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Relax,&#x201d; Nick held the forceps aloft. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just one bug. There&#x2019;s plenty more where that came from.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to leave, Dr. Polchak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because&#x2014;you&#x2019;re not a medical examiner, and you&#x2019;re not with the department. You shouldn&#x2019;t be here. It&#x2019;s not procedure.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not procedure. I have assisted the authorities on seventy-two cases in thirteen different countries. How many homicides did you have in Wake County last year? Five? Ten?&#x201d;<br> <br>The deputy shrugged.<br> <br>&#x201c;And how many of them did you work?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I never heard of any Bug Man,&#x201d; the deputy muttered.<br> <br>Nick glanced down at the man&#x2019;s stocking feet. &#x201c;Now there&#x2019;s a surprise.&#x201d;<br> <br>Now Nick turned to the motionless figure in the red chair. &#x201c;Mr. Allen,&#x201d; he called out. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Dr. Nick Polchak. I&#x2019;d like to ask you a few questions, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; came a whisper from under the hands. &#x201c;No questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Allen,&#x201d; the officer broke in. &#x201c;This man is not a part of the official police investigation. You don&#x2019;t have to answer his questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;But you can if you want to. And when the homicide people get here, Mr. Allen, they&#x2019;re going to ask questions&#x2014;quite a lot of them. First the police will ask you when you first discovered your wife&#x2019;s body.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man looked up for the first time. His face was ashen and drawn, and a deep purple crescent cradled each eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was less than an hour ago,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;I called the police immediately.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Immediately? Your wife has been dead for quite some time, Mr. Allen.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been out of town. I just got back, just today. And then I found her, like ... like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick nodded. &#x201c;Next the police will ask you where you were during that time.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man did a double take. &#x201c;Me? Why me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because the one who discovers the body is always a suspect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I said, I was out of town. I was in Chicago, on business. For a whole week&#x2014;they can check it out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they will,&#x201d; Nick said, &#x201c;and I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll find you&#x2019;re telling the truth. Their next question will be: What day did you leave for Chicago?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man thought carefully. &#x201c;Last Wednesday. The fourteenth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That would be ... seven days ago exactly. And prior to that time, Mr. Allen, did you see your wife alive and well?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We said good-bye right here, on Wednesday morning. She was perfectly healthy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure you left that day? On the fourteenth?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m sure! You think I can&#x2019;t remember a week ago?&#x201d; Nick held the specimen up and studied it closely. Then he looked back at Mr. Allen.<br> <br>&#x201c;Care to try again?&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick dragged a chair from the breakfast nook into the family room and sat down opposite the man, with the tiny white specimen still writhing in the forceps in his right hand. He offered the magnifier to the man. &#x201c;I want you to take a look at something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t look at that. Get that thing away from me!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh come now,&#x201d; Nick whispered. &#x201c;You have a stronger stomach than that&#x2014;don&#x2019;t you, Mr. Allen?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man looked startled; he hesitated, then reluctantly took the magnifier in his left hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pull up a chair,&#x201d; Nick called back to the deputy. &#x201c;Learn something.&#x201d; Nick slowly extended the forceps. &#x201c;Take a look at that end. Tell me what you see.&#x201d;<br> <br>The magnifier trembled in the man&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;Little lines,&#x201d; he mumbled. &#x201c;Sort of like slits.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How many little lines?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Three.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Give the deputy a look, Mr. Allen. Those &#x2018;little lines&#x2019; are called posterior spiracles&#x2014;think of them as &#x2018;breathing holes.&#x2019; The maggot you&#x2019;re holding is the larva of a common blow fly. That fly landed on your wife&#x2019;s body shortly after her death and began to lay eggs in the softest tissues&#x2014;the eyes, the mouth, and so on. Those eggs hatched into larvae, and the larvae began to feed and grow.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now when a larva grows, it passes through three distinct stages of development. Are you following me, Mr. Allen? Because this is the important part: The larva doesn&#x2019;t develop those breathing holes until the third stage. And after many studies, we know exactly how long it takes for this species of fly to reach that third stage of development. Guess what, Mr. Allen? It takes more than a week.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man began to visibly shake as Nick rocked back in his chair and folded his hands behind his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s see what we&#x2019;ve got so far. You&#x2019;ve been out of town for a week&#x2014;exactly a week. You say that you saw your wife alive one week ago, yet there are insects on her body that prove that she died more than a week ago.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well ... uh ...,&#x201d; the man stammered, &#x201c;maybe I was gone ... longer than I thought.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The airline&#x2019;s records can clear up that little point. And I&#x2019;m betting those same records will show that you made your reservations the same day that you traveled&#x2014;sort of a last-minute business trip, you might say. I have just one more question for you, Mr. Allen. The police won&#x2019;t ask you this one, but it&#x2019;s something I&#x2019;ve always wondered about ...&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick leaned forward again.<br> <br>&#x201c;When you strangle someone, can you feel the hyoid bone break, or is it all just sort of soft and squishy?&#x201d;<br> <br>The man jumped frantically from his chair and lunged toward the door. He ran like a man in a funhouse, stumbling first one way and then the other, throwing himself from wall to wall, ricocheting wildly down the hall toward the open door.<br> <br>The deputy sat frozen in astonishment, staring wide-eyed at the doorway.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think you&#x2019;re supposed to run after him,&#x201d; Nick said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what they always do on TV.&#x201d;<br> <br>The deputy thrust the magnifier and forceps into Nick&#x2019;s hands and raced barefooted down the hallway. Nick rose slowly from his chair, shook his head, and headed back toward the body. As he passed the hallway he caught a glimpse of the mahogany bureau just inside the front door.<br> <br>The top drawer was open.<br> <br>Nick ran to the door and leaped out onto the brick porch. There was no sign of the deputy or his quarry&#x2014;they had already rounded the house, probably headed for the woods in back.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s armed!&#x201d; Nick shouted. &#x201c;Your man is armed!&#x201d;<br> <br>No response.<br> <br>Nick looked both directions. He chose left and raced toward the corner of the house. &#x201c;An amateur cop chasing an amateur murderer,&#x201d; he said aloud. &#x201c;Someone could get killed this way.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rounded the corner in a wide arc, expecting to lengthen his stride into a long run for the woods&#x2014;but there, bracing himself against the far corner of the house, leaned the quivering figure of Mr. Allen. In his right hand a .357 magnum dangled toward the ground.<br> <br>Nick skidded to a halt. The man saw him, straightened, and wobbled out away from the house. He turned to face Nick and slowly raised the weapon. He couldn&#x2019;t steady it; Nick felt the barrel sweep back and forth across his body again and again. The man&#x2019;s arm shook so violently that he looked more like he was whitewashing a fence than aiming a firearm. Nick marked the distance between them&#x2014;fifty feet at least. At this distance, it would take several tries for the man to hit him.<br> <br>But it only takes one.<br> <br>&#x201c;Listen to me, Mr. Allen. You did something stupid. Don&#x2019;t make it worse. You cannot get away, and you know it. You&#x2019;re only running because you&#x2019;re scared.&#x201d;<br> <br>The gun swept past twice more, marking Nick with a broad X. &#x201c;Think, Mr. Allen. Maybe you didn&#x2019;t mean to kill your wife&#x2014;but if you shoot someone else, they&#x2019;ll hang you for sure. Put the gun down. Call a lawyer and see what you can work out.&#x201d;<br> <br>The gun began to steady ...<br> <br>Over the man&#x2019;s shoulder Nick saw a khaki figure step out silently from behind the house. The deputy drew his own handgun, leveled it, then opened his mouth as if to shout. Nick held up both hands and shook his head violently.<br> <br>You idiot! I&#x2019;m in your line of fire!<br> <br>Too late.<br> <br>&#x201c;FREEZE!&#x201d;<br> <br>The man spun around, firing wildly before he even faced his foe. The officer fired back; the first shot streaked over the man&#x2019;s left shoulder. Nick could feel it coming, he could sense the air compressing ahead of the bullet as it tore past his left ear.<br> <br>Nick dove for the ground. The man continued to fire blindly&#x2014;three shots into the ground, one into the air, two into the side of the house.<br> <br>The officer fired twice more, shooting for the torso, not trusting his own aim. The first shot caught the man in the lower abdomen and the second hit square in the chest. Nick watched the man take both bullets. It was not at all like the movies&#x2014;no violent recoil, no sense of impact at all. The man stood motionless for a moment, then his knees suddenly bent in opposite directions, and he sagged to the ground like a crumpling sack.<br> <br>Nick crawled toward the broken body. He pulled the gun away and tossed it aside; the barrel burned his hand. He placed two fingers on the carotid artery and waited.<br> <br>Nothing.<br> <br>Nick looked up at the deputy and shook his head. The officer&#x2019;s knees buckled, and he dropped to the ground, vomiting.<br> <br>Nick rolled onto his back and stared up into the April sky.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seventy-three cases,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><i>North Carolina State University, April 22, 1999</i><br> <br>&#x201c;Nicholas? A word, if you please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Nick stepped into the office of Dr. Noah Ellison, chairman of the department of entomology and by far the most senior professor in any department at NC State. Dr. Ellison quietly closed the door behind them.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nicholas,&#x201d; he began, wagging a spindly finger, &#x201c;it has been brought to my attention that you failed to appear for another of your classes yesterday.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Noah, I had to make a house call.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is my responsibility as chairman of this department to remind you that your contract involves a certain amount of teaching&#x2014;and your colleagues have reminded me that it is my duty to discipline you appropriately.&#x201d;<br> <br>Noah picked up Nick&#x2019;s right hand and slapped him on the wrist.<br> <br>&#x201c;Consider yourself disciplined. Please do not force me to resort to such extreme measures again.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man motioned for Nick to sit.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have good news and I have bad news, Nicholas. Which would you like first?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me both at the same time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Very well. The good news is the National Science Foundation has granted funding for your summer research proposal&#x2014;continuing study in your beloved field of forensic entomology. The bad news is that the grant is woefully inadequate, hardly more than a one-way ticket out of town.&#x201d;<br> <br>Noah slid a check across the desk. Nick glanced at it and rolled his eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t we do any better than this, Noah? Aren&#x2019;t there any departmental funds?&#x201d;<br> <br>He sh...</p><h2>The Spoken Word: British Writers, 3-CD Set (British Library - British Library Sound Archive)</h2><p><br><p>This three-CD boxed set of recordings documents&nbsp;some of the twentieth-century&#x2019;s most emulated and admired literary figures and continues the traditions of excellence evidenced by the American edition.

There are over 4000 biographical anecdotes about more than 2000 famous people. The book is international in scope and an entertaining walk through history. People representing all types of occupations are covered, from U.S. presidents to Greek philosophers to entertainers and sports figures. Brief biographical information is given about each person, and sources are given wherever possible. The anecdotes range in spirit from the very moving to the amusing and ridiculous, with the emphasis on the latter two. Typical is the entry under Hank Aaron: "During the 1957 World Series, Yankee catcher Yogi Berra noticed that Aaron grasped the bat the wrong way. 'Turn it around,' he said, 'so you can see the trademark.' But Hank kept his eye on the pitcher's mound: 'Didn't come up here to read. Came up here to hit.' " The arrangement is alphabetical by person, with name and subject indexes. The introduction includes an excellent essay on the definition, history and purpose of anecdotes. A thoroughly entertaining and useful reference source. Pat Royal, Prince George's County Public School System, Md.<br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.Anecdotes are brief stories we like to tell about people, more succinct than gossip and more respectable. Most in this dictionary have been "pilfered" (vii) from other collections, but on the other hand there are an informative introduction, an index of themes, and a bibliography of sources. The anecdotes themselves are arranged under the name of the person they're about. That this is a reference book, however, is doubtful: many of the anecdotes are followed by a cautionary note that they have been told of others as well or are apocryphal, and it's unlikely that much seriously useful biographical information is revealed in them, no matter how entertaining or true. More suitable for the bedside table than for the reference shelf. BOMC alternate.. William Wortman, Miami Univ.

Red and I had already been for our walk and he went to sleep on the bath mat while I was taking my shower. Red is a Cairn terrier. He&#x2019;s bath mat size. After the shower I was standing in front of the mirror in a toweling robe brushing my teeth. When I looked up I was gone.<br><br> It didn&#x2019;t startle me at first, not exactly. I thought it was just some trick of the light, a fog that had built up on the mirror, but when I wiped my sleeve over the medicine cabinet I still wasn&#x2019;t there. My toothbrush was there, floating by itself several inches out from the cuff of my robe, and the robe was there, the collar and shoulders filling out the bottom of the mirror&#x2019;s frame, but I was missing. I moved from side to side a couple of times trying to fit myself back into the picture, but all I saw was the open shower curtain behind me, the tiles of the tub, the built-�in shelf that held the shampoo and conditioner. I spat out the toothpaste and there it was in the sink looking exactly like toothpaste. That was when I thought: stroke. Pieces of my vision were missing, even though I couldn&#x2019;t imagine what kind of stroke would just remove a face, a neck, a hand. Leaning forward toward the mirror, I gently tapped my invisible fingers against my invisible cheek and what had once been a finger was stopped by what had once been a face. Curiosity was quickly being replaced by a rising wall of panic. I was fifty-�four years old, and I was gone.<br><br> &#x201c;Red?&#x201d; I said, trying out my voice. Unlike the rest of me, my voice was still there. Red lifted his head from the bath mat and looked straight at me, his brown eyes bright and full of recognition. He wagged his tail, thinking that maybe I wanted to go for another walk. Tentatively, I held out my invisible hand to him, wondering if I was dead and, if I was, what effect it would have on the poor dog. But Red sniffed the place where my hand should have been and gave it a couple of licks. I felt the rough wash of his tongue working over my phantom wrist, which I took to be a good sign, and so I went back to the mirror again. Still not there.<br><br> I went into the bedroom feeling light-�headed, or feeling like someone who didn&#x2019;t have a head, and, sitting down on the edge of the bed (which gave a creak of recognition), I picked up the phone and dialed the back-�line number at Arthur&#x2019;s office. I suppose that any day one finds one&#x2019;s self to be invisible was not going to shape up to be a lucky day, so when Arthur&#x2019;s nurse Mary answered I shouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised. Arthur has three nurses and getting Mary on the phone was the definite equivalent of drawing the short straw.<br><br> &#x201c;Dr. Hobart&#x2019;s office,&#x201d; she said, impatient from the start.<br><br> &#x201c;Mary, it&#x2019;s Clover. I need to speak to Arthur.&#x201d; I was struggling not to hyperventilate.<br><br> I could see her shaking her head. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in with a patient. Is there something I can help you with?&#x201d;<br><br> Maybe she thought I was calling in regard to a sick child, even though she knew that Nick was twenty-�three and Evie was twenty. &#x201c;Can you get him for me?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He has patients waiting in all five of the exam rooms with fourteen more in the waiting room.&#x201d; Her voice was both flat and brisk. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s in with the mayor&#x2019;s wife now. Their second-�grader has a rash. It could be a tick bite. We&#x2019;ve got a vomiting toddler in room three and a first-�time mother in room one who has brought in a week&#x2019;s worth of used diapers that she has been refrigerating because she thinks the stool is inconsistent.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I get it,&#x201d; I said, though there was nothing even notable about her report. This was Arthur&#x2019;s day, all day, every day, from the minute he walked in the door of his office until the minute he left, and even when he left, much of his work managed to follow him home. I understood it was her job to protect him in any way possible, to use herself to create a human shield between him and the world, but I never did appreciate the fact that she applied that same shield against me. I almost never called the office.<br><br> &#x201c;Is it an emergency?&#x201d; Mary asked.<br><br> &#x201c;It is.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; she said, but I could tell she had already been distracted. I could hear a shrill screaming in the background, and then, abruptly, the line went dead.<br><br> So there I was, the phone levitating in midair. I stared at it for a minute before hanging up. Even if I&#x2019;d gotten Arthur on the line he no doubt would have told me that children don&#x2019;t become invisible and so he wouldn&#x2019;t know anything about it. Arthur had a way of making it sound like he had attended some special sort of junior medical school at which he had received absolutely no information whatsoever about the human body past the age of sixteen. It was his means of deflecting grown-�ups who casually hit him up for Adderall prescriptions at dinner parties, but it also meant he never was much of a help to the adult members of his own family.<br><br> And who&#x2019;s to say I was invisible anyway? If I was cracking up, if I&#x2019;d just suffered some sort of cerebral hemorrhage, I would in fact be a poor judge of the situation. I tightened the belt on my robe and I marched up the stairs to Nick&#x2019;s room, Red right behind me. I could feel my bare feet against the floor. Nick is our oldest, and I opened the door to his room without knocking because he had gone away to college and stayed away for almost two years after graduating. I had made his room my office: a desk, a lamp, a chair. My mother had made my room a sewing room when I moved away. Now my computer was back in the kitchen. &#x201c;Nick!&#x201d; I said to the man who was sleeping face down and shirtless in a pile of crumpled sheets. &#x201c;Nicky, wake up!&#x201d;<br><br> When he didn&#x2019;t wake up I took hold of his heel with my invisible hand and shook it. I could see his entire leg turning back and forth inside the flannel pajama bottoms I had bought for him two Christmases ago; I could feel the heat of his heel in my palm. Red jumped into the bed and stood for a moment on Nick&#x2019;s back. In our household, only Red had experienced unequivocal joy at Nick&#x2019;s return.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he said into his pillow. It wasn&#x2019;t quite eight in the morning. It was for Nick an unseen hour.<br><br> &#x201c;I need you to look at me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You look fine,&#x201d; he said, or I think that&#x2019;s what he said. He hadn&#x2019;t lifted his head.<br><br> I flicked the switch to the overhead lights, and then I went to the windows and snapped up the rolling shades. With admirably quick reflexes, Nick drew himself into a ball and howled the howl of all vampires exposed to sunlight. In the light I could see that the room, which I had told him he would have to clean himself when he moved home six months ago, had not been cleaned. He scrunched his pillow down over the back of his head while Red buried his nose into the covers in search of Nick&#x2019;s nose.<br><br> &#x201c;What?&#x201d; he cried, either to me or the dog.<br><br> &#x201c;I need you to tell me if you can see me.&#x201d; I was trying to keep my voice steady but I could hear the panic.<br><br> He rolled over, blinking in my general direction. The light was burning his eyes. He pressed his chin down to his chest, lengthening his neck like a turtle. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Do. You. See. Me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like your bathrobe anymore? You want to know if it&#x2019;s becoming? I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re asking.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How can you not know what I&#x2019;m asking? Am I here?&#x201d;<br><br> Nick had been a history major at Oberlin, and though we had begged him to consider a minor in business, he had gone for women&#x2019;s studies instead. Women&#x2019;s studies, he informed us at the time, was a brilliant way to meet girls. &#x201c;Are you having some sort of breakdown?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I might be.&#x201d; My robe was shaking.<br><br> &#x201c;If you feel like I don&#x2019;t appreciate you, well,&#x201d; he said, rubbing his eyes, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s because I don&#x2019;t. I will again, but not until at least ten, okay?&#x201d; He put his arm over the dog and pulled him in tight like a wide receiver ready for a forty-�yard run. &#x201c;Please pull the shades on your way out.&#x201d;<br><br> That was when I turned and looked in the mirror over his dresser. There I was, my hair dripping and uncombed but recently touched up for gray, my cheeks bright red from a combination of fear and rosacea. I was back, so completely and utterly returned it was as if I had never been gone at all.<br><br> ...<br><br> Maybe it was just some weird aphasia, except instead of a temporary loss of speech I had experienced a selective loss of vision. As I dried my hair and put on the little bit of makeup that I associated with my own human dignity, I stared hard at my reflection, checking for any fuzziness or missing spots. Even after I was dressed I kept going back to the mirror to make sure I was still there. I couldn&#x2019;t spend more than two minutes away. Sure, I could see my hands, my legs, but was my face still there? My neck? Back I would go to check again. Spending a morning staring at oneself was hardly the short path to peace of mind. It was the mirror, after all, that had driven Snow White&#x2019;s stepmother around the bend with its unrelentingly frank assessment of the situation. Soon my worry about invisibility had been replaced by a cataloguing of flaws: my eyelids were drooping in a weird way that made my entire face look asymmetrical, and the crease between my eyebrows made me look as if I had been struck in the forehead by a very small ax. And my mouth! Where had my lips disappeared to over the years? I preferred the picture of myself I kept in my imagination, the one in which my hair could still be braided into a thick rope and I was in the neighborhood of thirty-�five.<br><br> I went across the street and three houses down to the Kemptons&#x2019;. I knocked on Gilda&#x2019;s door.<br><br> &#x201c;Have you ever noticed that my eyelids are uneven?&#x201d; I asked her. I was standing on the porch. There was a cold wind prying the last of the red leaves off the maple tree in her front yard and I shivered. That time of year thou mayst in me behold when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang.<br><br> &#x201c;Come inside,&#x201d; she said. She put her hands on my shoulders and moved me around in the light as if she was having trouble seeing me.<br><br> Upon those boughs which shake against the cold. Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.<br><br> &#x201c;I need to get my glasses,&#x201d; she said.<br><br> Gilda and Steve Kempton had five children, all of them boys, and their house always had the vague aura of a summer camp, even though four of those boys were technically grown and three of them were actually gone. There were always helmets and hockey sticks in the front hallway, always an odd number of tennis shoes on the stairs. In the summer the floors had a vaguely sandy crunch to them even though we lived in Ohio, and nowhere near a beach. Benny, the baby, was in high school now, and Miller, who was the second to the oldest, had boomeranged straight back into his childhood bedroom the day after graduating from college and had been there for more than a year. I believed that it was Miller who set the bad example for Nick.<br><br> Gilda came back with a pair of readers and, looking through her glasses, gave my eyelids serious consideration. Then she put her thumb between my eyebrows and made little circles over the crease there. &#x201c;I tried that,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t go away.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Botox.&#x201d; She tapped her own forehead, a smooth lake of tranquillity.<br><br> &#x201c;I did that once. You know I don&#x2019;t like needles. And anyway, the wrinkles grew back.&#x201d;<br><br> She shrugged and looked again. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t really notice it,&#x201d; she said, but not in a way that made me feel better. Gilda and I had been friends for twelve years, ever since we&#x2019;d moved into the neighborhood. It was her honesty that I counted on. If I needed a comforting lie I was perfectly capable of telling one to myself. She was walking into the kitchen, stepping over a couple of tennis racquets, and I followed her. She put the kettle on.<br><br> &#x201c;So if you aren&#x2019;t interested in needles, why are you making an assessment of your face? Your only two options are to fix it or live with it. There&#x2019;s no point in just beating yourself up about it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The thing is,&#x201d; I started tentatively, not knowing how to talk about what I wasn&#x2019;t really sure had happened, &#x201c;this morning&#x2014;�&#x201d; I stopped.<br><br> Gilda, that source of constant motion, stopped as well. &#x201c;This morning,&#x201d; she said. I could tell she was thinking I was about to give her bad news.<br><br> &#x201c;I was invisible.&#x201d;<br><br> Gilda turned and got down two cups from the cabinet beside the sink, let out a dispirited sigh, and then dropped a tea bag in each of those cups. &#x201c;I hate that.&#x201d;<br><br> Something in my spine caught a small jolt of current and straightened to attention&#x2014;�it was understanding, recognition. It was everything I was hoping for. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s happened to you?&#x201d;<br><br> Gilda lowered her chin and looked up at me, a move I now realized was meant to stand in for a knitted brow. &#x201c;Are you kidding me? Except for a very few breakout moments, I&#x2019;ve been invisible since the new millennium. The boys can be looking at naked women on Facebook and they don&#x2019;t so much as twitch when I walk into the room. I can ask Steve what time he wants to eat dinner and he keeps on texting like I wasn&#x2019;t even there. A woman wheels her cart right in front of mine and cuts into the checkout lane, a car cuts me off in traffic, I wave at the waiter and he&#x2019;s looking at the wall behind my head. It&#x2019;s just the plight of women after a certain age. No one can see you. Sometimes I find myself daydreaming about that girl I used to be, how I could always get a table in a busy restaurant. I could raise my hand on a street corner in New York in the pouring rain and get a taxi.&#x201d; She shook her head at such an impossible memory. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s just gone now. We&#x2019;re nothing but the ghosts of our former selves.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;True,&#x201d; I said. I had forgotten the feeling of going into a very busy restaurant at eight on a Friday night and getting a table without a reservation. &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s not what I&#x2019;m talking about.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;So what are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Invisibility. Literal invisibility.&#x201d; I sounded less than certain. Gilda and I told each other pretty much everything but I found these words were heavy in my mouth.<br><br> &#x201c;You mean where you walk right up to someone and it&#x2019;s as if they can&#x2019;t even see you?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, where I look in the mirror and can&#x2019;t see myself.&#x201d; There was nothing metaphorical about it.<br><br> &#x201c;Does this have to do with Arthur?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t even there. It was after he&#x2019;d left for work.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No, but I mean he&#x2019;s been very busy lately. You&#x2019;ve said it yourself. You hardly ever see him.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Which is not the same thing as hardly ever seeing myself. Do you think this is hysterical invisibility? I&#x2019;m developing some strange new disease in an effort to get the doctor&#x2019;s attention? The only way I could get Arthur&#x2019;s attention, medically speaking, is with a bad case of cradle cap.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t help how busy he is,&#x201d; Gilda said defensively. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s busy because he&#x2019;s good. He&#x2019;s busy because everybody loves him.&#x201d;<br><br> Everybody including Gilda. Not long after we&#x2019;d moved into the neighborhood, Arthur dislodged a grape from Benny&#x2019;s windpipe at a Fourth of July party and saved his life. Arthur had noticed that Benny, who was only three at the time, was standing stock-�still in the middle of a crowd of adults, just standing there, n...</p></p><h2>A Guide for the Perplexed</h2><p>Moses Maimonides was one of the foremost intellectuals of medieval Judaism.

Her voice is, by turns, naively whimsical and biblical in its assurance, and it speaks of what is partially remembered partly divined. The memories often concern a childhood in the Caribbean--family, manners, and landscape--as distilled and transformed by Kincaid's special style and vision.<br><br>Kincaid leads her readers to consider, as if for the first time, the powerful ties between mother and child; the beauty and destructiveness of nature; the gulf between the masculine and the feminine; the significance of familiar things--a house, a cup, a pen.

It is a masterly conflation of the Shakespearean history plays that feature Falstaff, the great comic figure played by Welles himself in the film. For Welles, the character was also potentially tragic: the doomed friendship between Falstaff and Prince Hal becomes an image of the end of an age. To this epic subject Welles brings the innovative film techniques that made him famous in <i>Citizen Kane, The Lady from Shanghai,"</i>and <i>Touch of Evil.</i><br><br>This volume offers a complete continuity script of <i>Chimes at Midnight</i>, including its famous battle sequence. Each shot is described in detail and is keyed to the original Shakesperian sources, thus making the volume an invaluable guide to Welles as an adaptor and creator of texts. The first complete transcription of the continuity script of <i>Chimes</i> is accompanied by the editor's critical introduction on Welles's transformation of Shakespeare; a special interview with Keith Baxter, one of the film's principal actors, which discusses its production history; reviews and articles; and a biographical sketch of Welles, a filmography, and a bibliography.</p><p></p><h2>Old Devil Moon</h2><p><p>&#x201c;[Christopher] Fowler repeatedly challenges the reader to redraw the boundaries between innocence and malevolence, rationality and paranoia.

British author Fowler, best known for his Bryant and May impossible crimes series (<i>White Corridor</i>, etc.), scores another triumph with his eclectic 10th short story collection. Highlights include The Lady Downstairs, a Sherlockian pastiche told from the perspective of the great detective's long-suffering landlady, Mrs. Hudson, and the grim revenge story, The Threads, in which an arrogant British tourist to North Africa gets his comeuppance. The amusing parody That's Undertainment! brutally eviscerates modern popular culture. Old Friends, an effective modern ghost story, pays homage to such late British film greats as Terry-Thomas and Diana Dors. John Wyndham would've appreciated the concise but horrific The Spider Kiss, in which an outbreak of insane human behavior in Miami proves to have its origins in the animal kingdom. Exclusion Zone focuses on a father's estrangement from his daughter's anarchic rebellion.

Canada's First Nations is an exploration of the experience of these peoples from their first appearance among the giant mammals that once roamed the land to their confrontations with<br>contemporary Canada. Aboriginal peoples have displayed both ingenuity and flexibility in their survival techniques. Their achievements in technology (the toggling harpoon, the canoe), and in the plant sciences (the development of maize, their herbal lore), have come to benefit the world. Their<br>cooperation and assistance was essential for the European exploration and settlement of what is now Canada: the value of this aid in economic terms alone has never been assessed.<br><br>Relying on archaeological, artistic, and linguistic evidence, Dickason explores Amerindian cultural traditions and values that were influential in developing the country's national and international personality. The book speculates that the rapid spread of aboriginal settlement throughout North<br>and South America and the richness of culture must have been the result of complex trade patterns which included the capability to cross oceans. In the historic period, it is evident that far from being simply overwhelmed, Amerindians often adapted to colonial pressures in their own ways, sometimes<br>mustering for wars in which their guerilla-like tactics were both original and often ferociously effective, but more often diplomatically playing off opposing French, English or American forces. But this is not a history of impersonal forces. It is the record of such people as Pontiac, Joseph<br>Brant, Tecumseh, Abe Okpik, Elijah Harper, Poundmaker, and Big Bear. While the history of Canada's native peoples is also the history of the exploitation of the North American continent, it also reveals the recreation of the native community in the fight for land claims, self-government, and<br>recognition of aboriginal rights.</p><p>Olive Patricia Dickason, Professor Emeritus, Department of History, University of Alberta.</p><h2>Sisters of Salome</h2><p>The origins of the art of exotic dancing lie in English drama and Viennese opera: Oscar Wilde&#x2019;s 1893 play <i>Salome</i>, and Richard Strauss&#x2019;s 1905 opera based on it, brought onto the stage a female character who captured and dominated the audience with the raw power of her naked body. Her Dance of the Seven Veils shocked and fascinated, and Salome became a pop icon on both sides of the Atlantic. Toni Bentley explores how four influential women embraced the persona of the femme fatale and transformed the misogynist image of a dangerously sexual woman into a form of personal liberation.</p><p>"No other historian has told the story of the femme fatale in nineteenth-century culture so well and so engagingly.

Just as Aeneas begs for one meeting with his dear father, so does Heaney (Selected Poems 1966 - 1987) , and much of the book records those glimpses. In the title poem he recollects "That afternoon / I saw him face to face, he came to me / With his damp footprints out of the river, / And there was nothing between us there / That might not still be happily ever after."18 Heaney's spiritual excursions, reminiscent of Dante's, to the ghostly past and underworld will remind readers of the difficulties of voyages of the soul: "So draw no attention, steer and concentrate / On the space that flees between like a speeded-up / Meltdown of souls from the straw-flecked ice of hell."84 Although readers may sometimes get lost in the windings of the otherworld so vigorously evoked, most will judge the journey well worth the effort. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Equus: A Play</h2><p>The Tony Award-winning drama deals with a psychiatrist&#39;s exploration of the psyche of a troubled seventeen-year-old boy who senselessly and systematically blinds six horses</p><p>"Remarkable...a psychiatric detective story of infinite skill."<p>-- Walter Kerr, "The New York Times"</p></p><h2>Colossus: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>A sweeping tale of courage, honor, and betrayal in the army of Alexander the Great</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>Babylon, 323 BC.

Leaders of America&#x2019;s Jewish community were delighted that Israel was now deemed a major strategic asset and, Finkelstein contends, exploited the Holocaust to enhance this newfound status. Their subsequent interpretations of the tragedy are often at variance with actual historical events and are employed to deflect any criticism of Israel and its supporters.<br><br>Recalling Holocaust fraudsters such as Jerzy Kosinski and Binjamin Wilkomirski, as well as the demagogic constructions of writers like Daniel Goldhagen, Finkelstein contends that the main danger posed to the memory of Nazism&#x2019;s victims comes not from the distortions of Holocaust deniers but from prominent, self-proclaimed guardians of Holocaust memory. Drawing on a wealth of untapped sources, he exposes the double shakedown of European countries as well as legitimate Jewish claimants, and concludes that the Holocaust industry has become an outright extortion racket.<br><br>Thoroughly researched and closely argued, <i>The Holocaust Industry</i> is all the more disturbing and powerful because the issues it deals with are so rarely discussed.</p><p><b>Norman G.

Why does my trial continue on and on? Did I somehow miss God What do you do when your dreams, your plans and your hopes blow up in your face? Who do you blame when everything in the Bible gave you hope but, then, all was destroyed? How do you refrain from being angry, bitter and blaming God in situations like this? If we are honest with ourselves all of us at one time or another, have felt like ?giving up.? Paul expresses it perfectly in 2 Corinthians 1:8 when he says that he ?despaired of life itself.? What did he do? How did he persevere? Most of us talk very openly about the need to ?be like Christ? and to have His characteristics of Love, joy, peace, but what about the fruit of longsuffering?the determination never to give up? God promises us that He will strengthen us; help us and uphold us. (Isaiah 41:10) The question is: How do we do our part? How do we, like Paul, patiently endure our trials by never giving up?

In early life he attended the University of Cincinnati and Hanover College, Indiana, before working as a newspaperman and magazine writer in the Midwest. His first foray into the mystery genre was The Fabulous Clipjoint (1947) which won the Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America for outstanding first mystery novel. As an author he wrote more than thirty novels and over three hundred short stories, and is noted for a bold use of narrative experimentation, as exemplified in The Lenient Beast (1956) Many of his books employ the threat of the supernatural or occult before concluding with a logical explanation, and he is renowned for both original plots and ingenious endings. In the 1950s he moved to Tucson and wrote for television and film, continuing to submit many short stories that regularly appeared in mystery anthologies. A cultured man and omnivorous reader, Brown had a lifelong interest in the flute, chess, poker, and the works of Lewis Carroll.

They represent a cross section of medieval Japan in its richness and complexity, a panoply of life teeming with all the possibilities and contradictions of the age.</p><p>Text: English<br> Original Language: JapaneseAs Skord explains in her helpful introduction, the term otogi-zoshi (literally, "companion booklets" or "companion stories") encompasses a body of about 400 short and thematically varied Japanese narratives from the late 1300s to the early 1800s, and Skord has chosen 13 examples here. Although who authored and who read these works remain unknown, it is Skord's convincing argument that the tales "represent a cross section of medieval Japan in all its richness and complexity . . . teeming with all the possibilities and contradictions of the age." Aided by endnotes, the reader can glimpse a realm in which indiscretion is a worse sin than adultery, in which appreciation of poetry defines a person's character. The tales are, as the title suggests, alternately comical and serious, scatological and openly didactic; all possess clear charm and a certain immediacy. At the same time they are slightly impenetrable for Westerners, often concluding with abrupt homilies or other shifts in tone, but this distancing effect proves alluring rather than alienating. Skord, a professor of Asian studies at Manhattanville College, has adapted this elusive form with energy and imagination.

It's a scene as old as Africa itself, yet its sudden, violent drama is always new. <br><br>Dereck and Beverly Joubert know it well. For decades they've lived among lions, winning international acclaim for their unique photographs and pioneering documentaries, which record lions' previously unknown behavior such as nocturnal forays and a willingness to stalk their quarry through water. Of all their long experience, the Jouberts consider their two years with the lions of Duba the most exciting, important research they have done&#x2014;here presented in fascinating text and 100 gripping images. <br><br>Month after month, they battled floods, hardship, and danger to capture these spectacular shots of the relentless blood rivalry played out on the Okavanga Delta every day as three separate lion prides harry a huge herd of buffalo. These massive beasts are challenging prey; they fight back fiercely, aggressively seeking out the big cats and attacking them with deadly thrusts of their sharp, sweeping horns. The lions leap and dodge, but not always swiftly enough to escape&#x2014;and so the ancient struggle goes on. <br><br>The companion volume to a new National Geographic film airing in 2006, this is an unforgettable once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of the world's most awe-inspiring hunters, the lethal and beautiful lions of Duba.</p><p>Dereck and Beverly Joubert, recently named National Geographic Explorers-in-Residence, are internationally acclaimed naturalists and cinematographers. Their many years with lions have yielded not only books like <i>Hunting with the Moon,</i> but such highly praised documentary films as <i>Eternal Enemies: Lions and Hyenas; Reflections on Elephants;</i> and <i>Lions of Darkness</i>&#x2014;an outstanding body of work that has won four Emmys, two Chris awards, and a George Foster Peabody award.Beverly and Dereck Joubert, famed filmmakers and writers (<i>Hunting with the Moon</i>, 1997), have produced another spectacular examination of wildlife in Africa. Botswana's Okavango Delta, a landlocked region of marshland, rivers, and islands, is the setting for what the authors refer to as the eternal dance: a relentless struggle between buffalo and the lions who prey upon them. Some of these lions were the largest the authors had ever seen, probably a result of the size of their enormous prey and of the effort required to negotiate the water, mud, and reed beds of their home. Following three lion prides active in the area, the authors studied and documented the act of predation itself. Often the setup for the hunt was very tactical and the hunt itself so intricate that it was clearly an example of planning and thinking ahead. Despite the constant hunting pressure, the buffalo herd was growing in number each year while the lion prides fluctuated in size, an example of the shifting balances between predator and prey.

Roger Hargreaves&#39; son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like. In response, Roger drew a small orange man with extraordinarily long arms that could reach anywhere and tickle anyone. The idea that a tickle could be a character in its own right sparked an idea in Roger&#39;s mind. Roger was a successful copywriter but he wanted to do something that would enable him to work from home and spend more time with his four children. He wondered if he could make a living writing and illustrating children&#39;s books so he wrote the first Mr Men titles: Mr Tickle, Mr Greedy, Mr Happy, Mr Nosey, Mr Sneeze and Mr Bump. The books were an instant hit and Roger went on to create many more Mr Men and Little Miss characters. What Roger really wanted was to make children laugh. Mr Silly was his favourite Mr Men story and, according to his family, encapsulates his humour most closely. Sadly Roger passed away in 1988, but his son Adam took over the series, introducing new characters and exciting new adventures. Roger once said, `I feel very happy to think that when the Mr Men and Little Misses are 100 years old, their readers will always be five.&#39;</p><h2>Louis Comfort Tiffany: Artist for the Ages</h2><p>Few American artists have undergone such shifts in critical opinion as Louis Comfort Tiffany. Initially as a painter, then as an interior designer and experimenter in the medium of glass, Tiffany attained a position of great status in the arts. However, when America joined the First World War, many critics considered his art shallow and outdated and throughout the &#39;30s and &#39;40s, he was generally forgotten. By 1946, his revival had begun with an exhibition held at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York, organised by Edgar Kaufmann Jr, Lillian Nassau and Edward Wormley. This lovely book, published to accompany the traveling exhibition opening at the Seattle Art Museum in October 2005, showcases 120 objects, illustrating his wide-ranging interests and placing him in context with other significant artists of his time.</p><p></p><h2>The Dark Tower III The Drawing Of The Three</h2><p>Further adventures in the realm of the Dark Tower, as the Last Gunslinger battles savage evil.</p><p>STEPHEN KING is a prolific and perennially bestselling author and an recognized master of the horror genre.

This is the number of your fate.</p><p>Three?</p><p>Yes, three is mystic. Three stands at the heart of the mantra.</p><p>Which three?</p><p>The first is dark-haired. He stands on the brink of robbery and murder. A demon has infested him. The name of the demon is HEROIN.</p><p>Which demon is that? I know it not, even from nursery stories.</p><p>He tried to speak but his voice was gone, the voice of the oracle, Star-Slut, Whore of the Winds, both were gone; he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere, turning and turning in the lazy dark. On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair; its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young man's neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh. Looking more closely, the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching, strangling hands. The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror.</p><p>The Prisoner, the man in black (who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted, a man named Walter) whispered chummily. A trifle upsetting, isn't he? A trifle upsetting ... a trifle upsetting ... a trifle-</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The gunslinger snapped awake, waving at something with his mutilated hand, sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him, desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull.</p><p>Instead a sea-bird, attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt, wheeled away with a frightened squawk.</p><p>Roland sat up.</p><p>His hand throbbed wretchedly, endlessly. His right foot did the same. Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there. The bottom half of his shirt was gone; what was left resembled a ragged vest. He had used one piece to bind his hand, the other to bind his foot.</p><p>Go away, he told the absent parts of his body. You are ghosts now. Go away.</p><p>It helped a little. Not much, but a little. They were ghosts, all right, but lively ghosts.</p><p>The gunslinger ate jerky. His mouth wanted it little, his stomach less, but he insisted. When it was inside him, he felt a little stronger. There was not much left, though; he was nearly up against it.</p><p>Yet things needed to be done.</p><p>He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about. Birds swooped and dived, but the world seemed to belong to only him and them. The monstrosities were gone. Perhaps they were nocturnal; perhaps tidal. At the moment it seemed to make no difference.</p><p>The sea was enormous, meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine. For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation. He had never seen such a body of water. Had heard of it in children's stories, of course, had even been assured by his teachers-some, at least-that it existed-but to actually see it, this immensity, this amazement of water after years of arid land, was difficult to accept ... difficult to even see.</p><p>He looked at it for a long time, enrapt, making himself see it, temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder.</p><p>But it was morning, and there were still things to be done.</p><p>He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket, careful to lead with the palm of his right hand, not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there, changing that hand's ceaseless sobbing to screams.</p><p>It was.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Next.</p><p>He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock. He removed the guns, swung the chambers out, and removed the useless shells. He threw them away. A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them, picked it up in its beak, then dropped it and flew away.</p><p>The guns themselves must be tended to, should have been tended to before this, but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition, he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather.</p><p>Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips; from that point they seemed dry. He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts. His right hand kept trying to do this job, insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain, and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again, like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel. In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice.</p><p>I see serious problems ahead, he thought again.</p><p>He put these shells, hopefully still good, in a pile that was dishearteningly small. Twenty. Of those, a few would almost certainly misfire. He could depend on none of them. He removed the rest and put them in another pile. Thirty-seven.</p><p>Well, you weren't heavy loaded, anyway, he thought, but he recognized the difference between fifty-seven live rounds and what might be twenty. Or ten. Or five. Or one. Or none.</p><p>He put the dubious shells in a second pile.</p><p>He still had his purse. That was one thing. He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning. By the time he was finished, two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it; conscious thought had become difficult. He wanted to sleep. He had never wanted that more in his life. But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial.</p><p>"Cort," he said in a voice that he couldn't recognize, and laughed dryly.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry. When the job was done, he held the one made for his left hand, cocked it ... and then slowly lowered the hammer again. He wanted to know, yes. Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks. But a click would mean nothing, and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen ... or nine ... or three ... or none.</p><p>He tore away another piece of his shirt, put the other shells-the ones which had been wetted-in it, and tied it, using his left hand and his teeth. He put them in his purse.</p><p>Sleep, his body demanded. Sleep, you must sleep, now, before dark, there's nothing left, you're used up- He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand. It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing, littered with sea-shells which had no color. Here and there large rocks protruded from the gross-grained sand, and these were covered with guano, the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth, the fresher splotches white.</p><p>The high-tide line was marked with drying kelp. He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line. He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadn't been washed out to sea by high-surging waves. Walking slowly, limping exquisitely, the gunslinger made his way to where they were. He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear. The other was empty. This one still had a little water left in it. Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two, but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which. He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long, long time. Water sloshed inside. That was good-a gift. Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw, but none had and the tide had spared it. Of the creature itself there was no sign, although the two of them had finished far above the tide-line. Perhaps other predators had taken it; perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea, as the elaphaunts, giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories, were reputed to bury their own dead.</p><p>He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow, drank deeply, and felt some strength come back into him. The right boot was of course ruined ... but then he felt a spark of hope. The foot itself was intact-scarred but intact-and it might be possible to cut the other down to match it, to make something which would last at least awhile.... Faintness stole over him. He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down, stupidly biting his tongue.</p><p>You won't fall unconscious, he told himself grimly. Not here, not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job.</p><p>So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist, but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again, half-fainting. He lay there awhile, one cheek pressed against the sand, the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood. He managed to drink from the waterskin, and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened. There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slope-it was stunted, but it would offer at least some shade.</p><p>To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles.</p><p>Nonetheless, he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade. He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him.</p><p>The palm of his hand was a dull red. Not a good sign.</p><p>I jerk off left-handed, he thought, at least that's something.</p><p>Then darkness took him, and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east. Morning was on its way. He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him.</p><p>He bent his head and waited.</p><p>When the faintness had passed, he looked at his hand. It was infected, all right-a tell-tale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist. It stopped there, but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines, which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him. He felt hot, feverish.</p><p>I need medicine, he thought. But there is no medicine here.</p><p>Had he come this far just to die, then? He would not. And if he were to die in spite of his determination, he would die on his way to the Tower.</p><p>How remarkable you are, gunslinger! the man in black tittered inside his head. How indomitable! How romantic in your stupid obsession!</p><p>"Fuck you," he croaked, and drank. Not much water left, either. There was a whole sea in front of him, for all the good it could do him; water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. Never mind.</p><p>He buckled on his gunbelts, tied them-this was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the day's actual prologue-and then tried to stand up. He was not convinced he could do it until it was done.</p><p>Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand, he scooped up the not-quite-empty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder. Then his purse. When he straightened, the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down, waiting, willing.</p><p>The faintness passed.</p><p>Walking with the weaving, wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness, the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand. He stood, looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine, and then took the last of his jerky from his purse. He ate half, and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly. He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had died-first seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks, then rising above them.</p><p>Roland held his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. He ate the rest of his jerky.</p><p>He thought: Very well. I am now a man with no food, with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with; I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire; I am sickening from a monster's bite and have no medicine; I have a day's water if I'm lucky; I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity. I am, in short, a man on the edge of everything.</p><p>Which way should he walk? He had come from the east; he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior. That left north and south.</p><p>North.</p><p>That was the answer his heart told.

He fell twice, and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again. Then a wave came toward him, close enough to make him remember his guns, and he was up before he knew it, standing on legs that quivered like stilts.</p><p>He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours. Now the sun was growing hot, but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face; nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him, making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter.</p><p>Fever, gunslinger, the man in black tittered. What's left inside you has been touched afire.</p><p>The red lines of infection were more pronounced now; they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow.</p><p>He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry. He tied it around his waist with the other. The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing. The sea to his right, the mountains to his left, the gray, shell-littered sand under the feet of his cut-down boots. The waves came and went. He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none. He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending.</p><p>Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up. This was the place, then. Here. This was the end, after all.</p><p>On his hands and knees, he raised his head like a groggy fighter ... and some distance ahead, perhaps a mile, perhaps three (it was difficult to judge distances along the unchanging reach of the strand with the fever working inside him, making his eyeballs pulse in and out), he saw something new. Something which stood upright on the beach.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>(three)</p><p>Didn't matter.</p><p>(three is the number of your fate)</p><p>The gunslinger managed to get to his feet again. He croaked something, some plea which only the circling seabirds heard (and how happy they would be to gobble my eyes from my head, he thought, how happy to have such a tasty bit!), and walked on, weaving more seriously now, leaving tracks behind him that were weird loops and swoops.</p><p>He kept his eyes on whatever it was that stood on the strand ahead.

Can Billy put his taste buds to the test and win, or will he work his way out of the deal?</p><p><i>How to Eat Fried Worms</i> has happily repulsed children since its original publication in 1973. Now youngsters can experience this classic story in a whole new yucky way, by listening to it on audiocassette. Narrator Jay O. Sanders gives extra kick and vitality to this already lively yarn. He throws himself into the role of a 10-year-old boy, facing the most revolting bet of his life. Billy must eat 15 worms in 15 days--but the reward will be worth it: $50 for a shiny new minibike. Luckily, Billy's friends cook up these fat juicy grubs in a variety of appetizing ways--drenched in ketchup and mustard, fried in butter and cornmeal, and the pi�ce de r�sistance, a Whizband Worm Delight (an ice-cream worm cake). Sanders derives obvious pleasure from reading (and singing) out loud the hilarious rhymes and childish chants concocted from the mind of the book's author, Thomas Rockwell.<p> "Trout, Salmon, flounder, perch,<br> I'll ride my minibike into church.<br> Dace, tuna, haddock, trout,<br> Wait'll you hear the minister shout."</p><p> <i>How to Eat Fried Worms</i> is a ghastly gastronomical treat that will dazzle young listeners.

Willcox</h2><p>The papers of Major General Orlando Bolivar Willcox, one of the most prominent division commanders in the Union army, were recently discovered locked in a trunk in a Washington, D.C., attic, virtually untouched since his death nearly a century ago. Editor Robert Garth Scott has sifted through what is arguably the largest collection of Civil War-related material to surface in fifty years. From his childhood in Detroit through his cadetship at West Point, his service in the Mexican, Seminole, and Civil Wars, and his post-Civil War experiences in the West, Willcox&#x2019;s story is published here for the first time.</p><p>Robert Garth Scott lives in Grand Blanc, Michigan. His past publications include Fallen Leaves: The Civil War Letters of Maj. Henry Livermore Abbott (The Kent State University Press, 1991).Forgotten Valor contains the experiences, observations and correspondence of a major military figure who hasn't been heard from previously. That in itself makes the book noteworthy since many modern Civil War books are recycled, reorganized material that has been published before. . . . More that just a Civil War memoir, the book is a biography of a military man who was a witness to much American history of the 19th century. -- <i>The Flint Journal 11/29/99</i><br><br>Forgotten Valor is a masterly piece of editing and compilation. . Willcox as a man of dimension and doubt, aspiration and disappointment participating in an immense chapter of his and his nations history is vivid in the book. . . . In short, Orlando Bolivar Willcox, confined as it were, in an old steamer trunk all these years, emerges as an individual and an admirable one, seriously concerned with his religious faith, his family and friends and his country. . . . It is a pleasure to meet him in these pages. -- <i>Washington Times, 10/30/99</i></p><h2>The Scents of Eden: A Narrative of the Spice Trade</h2><p>Traces European and American efforts to control the spice trade out of the Spice Islands from the early sixteenth century through the nineteenth century, detailing the impact of the spice trade on the growing world economy</p><p>A lucid and comprehensive account spanning the nearly four centuries of international intrigue and bloody struggle for control of the vast riches of the Spice Islands. At the dawn of the 16th century, the group of islands astride the equator to the east of Java known as the Moluccas became the stage for the first major colonial conflict played out by the seagoing European powers, and as Corn (Distant Islands: Crossing Indonesia's Ring of Fire, 1991) ably relates, the prizes were the most valuable commodities on earth: nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon, and later pepper. The Spanish were the first beneficiaries of a cargo of spices brought by the remaining ship of Magellan's last voyage, but it was the Portuguese, urged on by figures such as the Jesuit Francis Xavier, who militarily first took control of the spice trade. Control over the region was finally wrested in the early 17th century by the tyrannical Dutch East India Company, responsible for the massacre of 14,000 of the 15,000 inhabitants of the Banda Islands, the richest spice-producing islands in the East Indies. The final section of Corn's study focuses on the merchants of Salem, who carried on a fantastically lucrative trade in pepper with the canny and often treacherous rajahs on Sumatra. As in most good history books, readers will be challenged by a wealth of revelatory arcana; for instance, unbelievably, until the mid-18th century botanists believed that plants native to one region could not be grown anywhere else; as part of the treaty eliminating England as a player in the Moluccas, Holland traded New Amsterdam- -later Manhattan--to the English for a tiny island two miles long and a half mile wide. This is as pleasurable and eye-opening a history as one would hope for, generous in its descriptions of exotic islands and exciting in its depictions of the men who made fortunes in their waters. (maps) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>For those for whom the Spice Islands conjure romantic visions of South Seas paradise, intrigue, and piracy, this book will not be a letdown. Covering the age of exploration, it is an informal history of the European invasion and the islanders' futile resistance, ending with the U.S. presence in the islands in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Corn (<i>Distant Islands: Travels across Indonesia</i>, 1991) takes the reader from the founding of Malacca by Sumatran refugees right through the successive waves of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and English invasions (the first English colony in the world, on the tiny island of Pulau Run, gave them a presence in the area, which they relinquished in 1667 at the Peace of Breda in exchange for Manhattan). Corn details the roles of such figures as Magellan, Francis Xavier, the infamous Jan Pieterszoon Coen, and Francis Drake. But this book is more than a chronicle of voyages and invasions as Corn endeavors to show how the spice trade was the catalyst of the expanding world economy, the bridge between feudalism and capitalism. <i>Frank Caso</i></p><h2>Handbook to prayer: Praying Scripture back to God</h2><p>This prayer tool will guide you through the process of praying Scripture back to God.

This gets Barlow thinking about the nature of our relationship with food&#x2014;what&#x2019;s delicious, what&#x2019;s nasty, and what sort of obligation we have to the animals we eat. Over the course of one glorious, bilious year, Barlow vows to eat everything but the squeal. &nbsp;In his travels, Barlow takes part in the thousand-year-old antthrowing festival of Laza. He makes pig-bladder puddings for carnival. He washes down lots of pork with lots of wine. <p></p>In the tradition of Calvin Trillin and Anthony Bourdain, <i>Everything but the Squeal </i>is an adventure in extreme eating, a hilariously quirky travel book, and a perceptive look at how what we eat makes us who we are.</p><p>JOHN BARLOW studied English literature at Cambridge. He is the author of a collection of novellas, <i>Eating Mammals</i>, which won a <i>Paris Review </i>Discovery Prize, and the novel <i>Intoxicated</i>, which has been translated into four languages. He lives in Spain with his wife and son.&nbsp; <i>Everything but the Squeal</i>January, and we&#x2019;re in Spain. But this is not the Spain most people know. The rain is incessant, it&#x2019;s freezing cold, and the wind sounds like a jet engine playing the bagpipes. We&#x2019;re driving slowly along the side of a broad, sweeping valley that stretches way into the distance, a crazy quilt of lush green pastureland, any greener and it wouldn&#x2019;t seem natural. Above us the steel gray sky is cram-packed with fast-moving rain clouds that spit and snarl down at us as we peer ahead. With that familiar sinking feeling, we realize we&#x2019;ve been on this stretch of road before. We don&#x2019;t know where we are, the clock is ticking, and we&#x2019;re hungry.Then, quite by chance, we find it. Pulling up at the side of the road, we sit for a moment and look out across the valley. Stone-built farms crop up here amid the potent grassy greens, but now, on a rainy lunchtime, there&#x2019;s no one in sight. And lunch is exactly why we&#x2019;re here. I dash out of the car and struggle to erect the stroller. A wheezing blast of wind slaps me hard in the face. <i>On purpose.</i> We&#x2019;re in Galicia, and it&#x2019;s time to eat.We scurry across the road toward a large old tavern that stands right on the road&#x2019;s edge. There is no sign, no nameplate. Is it in fact the place we&#x2019;ve been looking for? We&#x2019;ve lost the directions, so we&#x2019;ll never really know. For a moment the thought depresses me. Yet this sense of doubt, of not knowing <i>for sure</i>, is a very Galician state of mind. In any case, it definitely looks <i>like</i> the place we thought we were looking for. We go in, already soaked.Inside is an old rustic bar, probably the center of local activity: social club, general store, domino school. The walls boast a few stuffed animal heads and one or two hunting rifles, as well as faded sepia photographs of a nearby monastery that we&#x2019;ve just driven past twice in a state of mild confusion. A notice board carries snippets of parish news, and pinned there, right in the middle, is a small, computer-printed poster in vivid colors. A bristly face stares out at us: two glossy eyes, pert little snout, a real sweetheart. It&#x2019;s the kind of shot you might see on an animal welfare ad. XABAR�N! the poster announces in big red letters: WILD BOAR!Boars are not uncommon in the remoter, wooded parts of Galicia, although their numbers are not huge. Perhaps the poster is part of an awareness-raising campaign, I tell myself, a scheme to help the native animal survive the incursion of modernity on its habitat. But I must be getting confused with campaigns to save the Iberian lynx or the brown bears of the Pyrenees. Because as I read on, it becomes clear that the poster is in fact a warning: <i>Boars in the area!</i> Apart from the suggestion that you get your shotgun oiled and loaded, there are a number of useful tips on repelling the evil lettuce-munchers before they trample your market garden to bits. Sprinkling the ground with clippings of human hair, it suggests, will convince these extremely unsociable creatures to stay away. I imagine long queues at the village barbershop, the hair of local farmers getting shorter by the week as the siege of the boars intensifies; then their wives surrender to the scissors, followed by the old folk and the children, until the entire village is bald, but boar-free.We turn to the bar itself. The proprietor dithers, almost avoiding our stare. He is not pleased to see us. Two parents and a sleeping baby in a stroller, all windswept and disheveled and dripping onto the stone floor. Have we booked? No. He rubs his chin, and says that he&#x2019;ll see what he can do. But it does not look good. A wash of pure negativity overwhelms him. He shakes his head and seems pained and deflated on our behalf.Galicians enjoy their negatives like no one else. There&#x2019;s nothing vindictive about it, and neither is it the act of refusal itself that they so enjoy. Rather, it&#x2019;s the indulgence in a sort of constitutional pessimism, an ever-present doubt, a looming complication, something that must be resolved. Or not. Sometimes this seeming negativity might even be a sort of strange friendliness. A straightforward &#x201c;yes&#x201d; is just too curt, too bland. A =) egation, on the other hand, is an invitation to explore the topic further, to muse, to ponder, to seek a solution, or to bemoan the lack of one. Here, in the rain-swept north-western corner of Spain, &#x201c;no&#x201d; has many shades of meaning. Straightforwardness is simply anathema to the Galician character. Meet a Galician halfway up the stairs, it is said, and he&#x2019;ll be unable to tell you which way he&#x2019;s going: <i>Well, that depends ...</i> , he&#x2019;ll ruminate, dodging the affirmative as if it&#x2019;s a ball of shit flying straight at him. And trying to insist on a straight yes-no answer from a Galician is just asking for trouble. I know; I&#x2019;m married to one.The proprietor decides it is necessary for him to go talk with his wife. We really should have booked, he says as he slouches off, shaking his head and tugging on his saggy cardigan.Making a reservation has never been strictly necessary in Galicia, especially in less formal places. Eating out, like much else, is a relaxed affair. You turn up, and you eat. However, things are changing. Restaurants of all kinds are booming, and this particular one, though by rights it&#x2019;s a cantina, a kind of rustic eatery, is full. There&#x2019;s a move in this part of Spain toward a greater appreciation of traditional cuisine. Not that the old dishes have ever gone out of fashion, but the rustic is becoming more and more valued, especially by city folk, a process that perhaps has something to do with a gradual rise in Galician nationalism. Food and nationhood are nowhere more closely related than in this small, soggy bit of the Iberian Peninsula.The boss returns with his far bossier wife. She has a look of redoubtability to her, extra-thick-set in her kitchen apron, her eyes never showing the least sign of amiability when they flick over you. But it&#x2019;s all part of the act, the mentality of suspicion, that initial where-are-you-from glance, the same as you&#x2019;ll find in rural villages everywhere. Whenever I stop at a bar or a shop in some out-of-the-way place, and the person in question shows not the least sign of appreciating my friendly visitor smile, it kind of hurts. There I am, miles from the nearest cell phone signal, gallantly ignoring the smell of manure ... and I can never understand why on earth these people do not give a toss that I have arrived, eager to take in their quaint ways, and are not immediately won over by my inanely deferent grin.The redoubtable one reminds us that we haven&#x2019;t booked, making it sound like an illness that might get a lot worse before it gets better. She and her husband breathe long sighs, as if they&#x2019;re standing above the open grave of our dearly departed lunch. We plead silently with our eyes, knowing that we&#x2019;ve done wrong: if this place is full, all the other cantinas in the area will be full too. She actually seems to suck in the air, chew on it, then let it out again, shaking her head slowly. Were this Hollywood, I would simply draw a twenty-dollar bill from my wallet and tuck it into the man&#x2019;s palm with a knowing squeeze. But we are in Galicia, and I suspect that a deft bribe would be greeted with a scornful chuckle, but no table.A reservations list is examined, and opinions are exchanged in low voices. In the stroller, Nico sleeps on, oblivious to the concern that his arrival has caused. I let Susana do the talking. She was born into this culture of pathological <i>uhm</i>ing and <i>ah</i>ing, and is capable of smothering the most insistently negative person with wave after wave of angelic patience. I have absolutely no doubt that she will get us a table. If you really want to eat somewhere but have no reservation&#x2014;whether it&#x2019;s got three Michelin stars on the wall or spit and sawdust on the floor&#x2014;take my wife along; she&#x2019;ll get you in. Considering that I myself am a very, very impatient food writer, I think I chose well.As negotiations continue, I look around. The room where we are standing is spacious. It has a high ceiling and perhaps nine or ten tables. The bar itself is a long one, running the length of two of the walls. As our fate hangs in the balance, it strikes me that every single table is empty. It is just coming up to three o&#x2019;clock, prime Spanish lunchtime. There is not one other person here. Yet it is full.We are finally granted lunching rights, and reminded to book next time. It is only now, with relief and humility making me light-headed, that I detect something on the air. Below the musty-yet-fresh smell of a place where mud-encrusted boots are the accepted footwear (the stuffed animal heads no doubt add a backnote), a familiar aroma is wafting toward us, and it seems to be coming from a curtained doorway in the corner. A familiar smell, sweet and meaty, pungently savory, a smell that, at its strongest, actually drapes itself across the membranes of your nostrils and <i>dares</i> you to inhale: hot hog.

To our surprise, we find seven or eight tables there occupied by people happily at lunch. Since becoming a cantina, it seems, the owners have fitted out a back room especially for the new class of customer: smarter chairs, curtains that match the tablecloths and napkins (a loud orange and yellow check), the well-scrubbed stone walls adding to the bucolic charm, unlike the old bar through the curtains, where they were just stone walls with a pleasant accumulation of grime.

Here are the vibrant colors, both natural and manmade, of the tropics; the beating sun on the beaches and the beating drums of a joyous band; and, of course, the faces and figures of that country's famously exhibitionistic women. Gibson's photographs have often focused, with unusual sharpness, on a single geometric element (the corner of a room, for instance) or a single human gesture (the curve of a hand). Now his remarkable eye picks up on the neck of a guitar, framed against the white sands of the beach, a reminder of his exploration of the three dimensional within photography. The chiaroscuro of shadow and white linen evokes his previous black-and-white portraits. And a portrait of a man whose head is obscured by a soccer ball, a witty quote of Magritte, connects with Gibson's lifelong interest in Surrealism. <br> <br>The art, music, and culture of Brazil is growing increasingly popular around the world, and those who want a master's look at this endlessly fascinating land will enjoy this collection of photographs, all of which are published for the first time here.</p><p>Born in Los Angeles in 1939, <b>Ralph Gibson</b> is a renowned photographer, editor, teacher, and publisher. He assisted Robert Frank and Dorothea Lange and has collaborated with many of the masters of photography. His publishing house, Lustrum Press, produced some of the seminal books of the twentieth century, including Robert Frank's <i>The Lines of My Hand</i>, Danny Seymour's <i>A Loud Song</i>, and Larry Clark's <i>Tulsa</i>. His work can be found in many major photographic collections around the world.</p><h2>The Other Shore</h2><p>Presents five recent plays by the Nobel Prize-winning author and includes commentary and selected criticism on his plays.</p><p>When Gao Xingjian won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000, he became the only Chinese writer to achieve such international acclaim. The Chinese University Press is the first publisher of his work in the English language. Indeed, The Other Shore is one of the few works by the author available in English today. <i>The Other Shore: Plays by Gao Xingjian</i> contains five of Gao's most recent works:<i>The Other Shore</i> (1986), <i>Between Life and Death</i> (1991), <i>Dialogue and Rebuttal</i> (1992), <i>Nocturnal Wanderer</i> (1993), and <i>Weekend Quartet</i> (1995). With original imagery and in beautiful language, these plays illuminate the realities of life, death, sex, loneliness, and exile. The plays also show the dramatist's idea of the tripartite actor, a process by which the actor neutralizes himself and achieves a disinterested observation of his self in performance. An introduction by the translator describes the dramatist and his view on drama.Born and educated in China, Gao studied French literature at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute between 1957-1962. He became a resident playwright at the Beijing People's Art Theatre after the Cultural Revolution. His plays have been performed all around the world, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, the Ivory Coast, the United States, France, Germany and other European countries. The <i>Other Shore</i> was banned in China in 1986 and since then none of his plays have been performed there. He settled in France in 1987 where he was awarded the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government in 1992. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2000.Gilbert C. F. Fong is an associate professor in the department of translation at The Chinese University of Hong Kong and is heading a research project on the history of Hong Kong drama. He is also the editor of the monographs <i>Studies on Hong Kong Drama</i> and <i>Plays from Hong Kong</i>, and of the journal <i>Hong Kong Drama Review.</i></p><h2>The Story of St. Patrick: More Than Shamrocks and Leprechauns</h2><p>Buried beneath the St. Patrick&#39;s Day symbols of shamrocks and leprechauns lies the story of a man determined to share the message of salvation with the people who made him a slave.

I can&#x2019;t help but remember the conditions we experienced in South Africa under apartheid. We could not have achieved our freedom without the help of people around the world using the nonviolent means of boycotts and divestment to compel governments and institutions to withdraw their support for the apartheid regime.

Infamous for his controversial views on race, he loves to treat iconic figures such as Toni Morrison and Spike Lee as critical pincushions. However, he has built his career primarily as a reviewer and essayist. <i>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</i>, then, represents his first attempt at fiction.<p> Crouch's novel tells the story of a mixed-race couple, both musicians, living in New York City. Maxwell is a black sax player; Carla is a white jazz singer. Their love for each other seems to transcend race--yet the great American dilemma keeps interfering, and as they try to gain acceptance from friends and family, jazz is the one thing that soothes them. In a typical altercation, a black man in a parking lot derides Carla as a "stringy-haired white girl." But as she listens to Maxwell perform immediately afterward, the very notes he plays seem like the best possible rebuttal, "more masculine and more tender and more androgynous and more than male or female or happy or sad or frightened or brave or knowing or befuddled than anything she had ever heard her man play."</p><p> <i>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</i> is an awkwardly written novel, and a slow-moving one at that. Long passages are devoted to descriptions of the music Carla and Maxwell create, and while Crouch has inherited Albert Murray's mantle as one of our most lively jazz critics, his own voice merges with those of his characters in an odd and distracting way. They end up sharing both the author's appetite for provocation and his wordiness, which undermines the greatest mystery of music in the first place--its wordlessness. Crouch also has a propensity for bizarre metaphors attributed to inner states, a prime example being this thorny item: "the sudden spread of this interior cactus." Finally, female readers should be warned: one of Carla's major strengths is that despite her white skin, she has a black ass. Perhaps that's progress. And perhaps Crouch's editors were so intimidated by his reputation that they neglected to tell him when he was playing out of tune. <i>--Emily White</i></p>"<b>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</b> is a fresh vision, one that dares to take risks in the name of truth: a novel that brims over with engaging characters and observations of contemporary American life that are so insightful they break the spell of racial ideologies and agitprop fiction that have for too long distorted our understanding of what black (and American) literature can be. It is a novel that we need as we enter the twenty-first century, a stern and rich and correcting vision that will help us, one and all, to create a more humane America." <br>-- Charles Johnson<br><br>"[This is] the American novel, the novel we've been hoping would be written about what happened to all of us and our country since the 1960s. Stanley Crouch, the most savvy chronicler of the American soul in all our hues, knows, like Balzac, Faulkner, and Ellison, that the vitality of the novel means putting the real 'stuff' in it. . . . He is absolutely brilliant in his knowledge of how men and women talk, think, touch, and feel each other." <br>-- Barbara Probst Solomon<br><br>"A bold epic by a man who still feels, cares, thinks, and believes. Who better than Stanley Crouch in this country at this time to lay out the feast of American passion and paradox?" <br>-- Bharati Mukherjee<br><br>"In matters of race, few Americans feel that they can say exactly what they think. What one feels in reading <b>Don't the Moon Look Lonesome</b> is an immediate relief from the burden of ideology, from 'more of the same.' For Stanley Crouch, the facts are color free." <br>-- Saul Bellow</p><h2>Versailles: A Novel</h2><p>Wittily entertaining and astonishingly wise, this novel of the life of Marie Antoinette finds the characters struggling to mind their step in the great ballroom of the world.</p><p>Kathryn Davis is the author of the novels Labrador, The Girl Who Trod on a Loaf, Hell, The Walking Tour, and Versailles. She teaches at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, and lives in Vermont and New York with her husband and their daughter.My soul is going on a trip. I want to talk about her. I want to talk about her. Why would anyone ever want to talk about anything else?<br> My soul is a girl: she is just like me. She is fourteen years old and has been promised in marriage to the French Dauphin, who also has a soul though more visible and worldly, its body already formed (so I&#x2019;ve been told) from layers of flesh and fat. In France they piss into chamber pots made of lapis and dine on common garden slugs. In France their hands smell like vanilla and they shoot their flcches d&#x2019;amour indiscriminately in all directions, flowing to their taste for books pernicious to religion and morals.<br> My soul is also powerful, but like a young girl it has wishes and ideas yes! a soul can have ideas like a mind does. Antonia, Antonia, you must pay attention,&#x201d; I can still hear Abb� Vermond implore me, waving a book in my face when all I wanted to do was dance dance dance, as if he actually believed that to be light of heart is the same as being light of head.<br> We traveled in a carriage coated with glass and lined with pale blue satin, beautifully swift, magnificently sprung. The end of April and the clouds compact and quick-moving, the fields turning from pale to deeper green, and the fruit trees&#x2019; veiled heads humming with bees. From Vienna to Molck, from the valley of the Danube to the Castle of Nymphenburg, whose inhabitants behaved like swine. Bells pealed all along our route and uniformed men shot off guns; little girls tossed flower petals in our path. The white horses of the Danube were here one minute, gone the next; one minute we slipped into the Black Forest&#x2019;s long cool shadows, the next out onto a hot sunny plain.<br> The world where you must pass your life is but transitory,&#x201d; or so advised my papa from beyond the grave. There is naught save eternity that is without end.&#x201d; In my lap I had my dear little pug, the smell of whose ears will always be sweeter to me than all the perfumes of Araby and the scent of heliotrope combined.<br> Twenty thousand horses stabled along the road from Vienna to Strasbourg no sooner did one of our steeds begin to lather up and stumble than it was ground into cat meat and a new one found to take its place. Serving women, hairdressers, dressmakers, surgeons, furriers, chaplains, apothecaries, cooks. Each night we managed to consume 150 chickens, 270 pounds of beef, 220 pounds of veal, 55 pounds of bacon, 50 pigeons, 300 eggs.<br> I was eager to please, though that meant something other than acquiesce to another&#x2019;s desire. Pleasing meant my own desire: the place where my body and soul met, like the musician&#x2019;s bow bearing down on the string, teasing a sound out: ah ah ah ah ah!<br> My soul thought she&#x2019;d be happy, and then, one day, she&#x2019;d die.<br> But, die.<br> What does this mean?<br> One day Antoinette will not exist, though her soul will continue to flourish.<br> And WHO IS THAT? WHAT IS THAT?<br> By the time we stopped for supper at the Abbey of Schuttern I had no appetite at all, even though the nuns tried tempting me with pilchards and apricots and kugelhopf; I admit I wept a little. It was the sixth of May; we&#x2019;d been on the road for over two weeks. From my bedroom window I could see the Rhine, which looked wide and flat and the color of lead, and the light on it looked like the pilchards had, silver and skinny and unappetizing. I heard a door creak, the sound of footsteps. Angry voices arguing below, fighting over the wording in the marriage contract, by which I was to be deeded away like a cottage or a plot of land to the people of France. A fork of lightning over the Rhine, and the Lorelei&#x2019;s long ghostly arm lifting to meet it . . .<br> But Mama would never let me get away with such silly thoughts I missed her so much I thought I&#x2019;d die. You must eat everything on your plate, Antonia. No picking and choosing. Why have you not eaten all your fish? How many times must I tell you that the child who gives in to foolish fears will never amount to much as an adult. Come here, let me take a good look at you &#x201d; peering at me through a magnifying glass. You seem so small for your age. How is your health?&#x201d; Her white white hair and her white white teeth, one of which she&#x2019;d had pulled while giving birth to me. Antoinette and a decayed molar, both of us rejected by my mother&#x2019;s body about eight o&#x2019;clock in the evening, All Souls&#x2019; Day, 1755.<br> It was getting dark; the moon was coming up over the river. At home Carlotta would be saying her prayers and Maxie sneaking cheese to his pet mouse, poor Anna lying there with her hands folded across her chest like an effigy of herself, unable to stop coughing. Joseph and Christina, Elizabeth and Karl. Amalia, Leopold, Johanna, Josepha. Mama sitting in her private apartments, sipping her warm milk and signing state papers. Her head shorn and the walls draped in black ever since Papa&#x2019;s death, whiiiiich she recorded in her prayer book, Emperor Francis I, my husband, died on the 18th of August at half past nine o&#x2019;clock. Our happy marriage lasted 29 years, six months and six days, 1,540 weeks, 10,781 days, 258,774 hours&#x201d; despite his numerous and humiliating infidelities.<br> At least I had my little pug with me, Gott sei dank! Tomorrow I would stop speaking German forever, but not tonight. I could see where we were headed and it was black as pitch.<br><br>Goosefoot<br><br>The approach to Versailles from the east is through forests of royal hunting preserves the Bois de Boulogne, Saint-Cloud, home to wild pigs and guinea fowl as well as the lesser forms of human life alternating with stretches of open farmland. Here the wheat is grown that will be harvested in late summer and ground into the loaves of bread that will be viewed with mystical respect&#x201d; by the King of France himself.<br> The baker who bakes bread must do it properly, according to the legal standard, which states that it shall be made of the best wheat on the market or within two deniers of that price. And if it is found to be poorly baked or too small in size, the baker shall pay a fine of five sols and the bread shall be given to the poor . . .<br> The sky is gray. It is raining. The approach to Versailles from the east is through dense shadowy forests, the branches of the trees heavy and wet and dripping, and behind every tree a wild animal, a cutpurse, a whore. No wolves, though the wolves are all dead and gone, hunted out of existence by Louis XIII, quite the hungry old wolf himself.<br> Over the Seine and onto the Avenue de Paris, the centermost of the three tree-lined roads comprising the famous patte-d&#x2019;oie, or goosefoot, that converges at the palace gate. Rain is beading on the gold blade at the tip of each of the gate&#x2019;s gold rails, beading up and then streaming down to pool darkly, muddily, on the ground. No matter how frugal the reigning monarch, there never seems to be enough money. The fountains appear broken, their basins clogged with debris, and in the gardens several statues have fallen off their pedestals and are lying on their sides in the wet grass like drunkards.<br> A dark morning and overcast, but on the approach to the chateau no one has lit a single lantern.<br> The goosefoot was the idea of Le N�tre, the Sun King&#x2019;s beloved gardener; he wanted to impress on the landscape the same cross the architect traces in the soil to indicate the main axes of a building. Versailles is actually a little out of alignment. The brass meridian marker traverses the Chamber of the Pendulum Clock diagonally rather than north to south, a fact no one likes to talk about because solar symbolism is crucial to the King&#x2019;s sense of cosmic destiny. How happy it makes him to watch the sun rise above his forecourt and set beneath his gardens! They extend on either side of the Grand Canal, endlessly unrolling toward the western horizon, where they at last slip through a gap between two poplars and plunge off the edge.<br> An unfortunate site for the seat of Bourbon power, really: a hillock of unstable sand in the middle of a swamp in a wind tunnel of a valley.<br> Of course subsequent French theoreticians have embraced the idea of Versailles&#x2019;s misalignment, perhaps in the same spirit with which they consider frog legs a culinary triumph.<br> It&#x2019;s always better to make something out of nothing that&#x2019;s the French way.<br>And then the bed curtains part. How many nights? A thousand and one, give or take a few?<br> Though instead of telling tales I scratch my husband&#x2019;s flea bites, the only itch he&#x2019;ll let me scratch, poor thing. The bed curtains part and in he comes, my very own King of France, just as he did that first night so many years ago, his little eyes blinking uncontrollably in what I took to be a colossal effort to see me in all my tender dishabille, though I now know he was merely trying to stay awake. The sound of wind, of rain pattering onto the leaves of the orange trees, and, even at so late an hour, feet racing up and down the Stairways of the Hundred Steps.<br> Versailles in the spring beloved Versailles! frogs croaking deep within the basins of her fountains, in the puddles left by the afternoon&#x2019;s storm. The anguished cry of a star-crossed lover, a few far-off rumbles of thunder like dice flung across a gaming table. All the remembered sounds of my earliest acquaintance with the place, but muffled, muffled, and then, for the briefest fraction of an instant, vivid again . . .<br> It was my wedding night. I had just stepped out of my bridal gown embroidered with white diamonds the size of hazelnuts. The bed curtains parted and there was my new husband&#x2019;s face, strangely bridelike itself in its frame of white organdy and displaying the same slack-jawed expression I&#x2019;d noticed earlier that evening on his grandfather&#x2019;s face, bored to death as any sensible person would be by the endless hands of cavagnole and endless trays of hors d&#x2019;oeuvres, though without the old King&#x2019;s dark catlike eyes, his interest in female anatomy, my breasts in particular. The old King was looking straight at them as he warned his grandson not to overeat and made no effort to conceal his annoyance when Louis sagely observed that he always slept better on a full stomach.<br> Which is probably why he chose to bring a plum tart with him into the nuptial chamber, holding it tenderly on his palm like a pet. He took his place on the right side of the bed and, without saying a word, began to cut the tart into many tiny pieces with the same pocketknife I&#x2019;d seen him use on the Host. Singing off key, a song about the hunt, lalalalala, and then waving the blade in my face, grudgingly, as if to suggest that if I were really hungry I could scrape clean the knife no thank you! with my teeth.<br> A tall fellow, Louis, a regular hop-pole, narrowly built and long- boned, though you could hardly tell since the lanky youth he might&#x2019;ve been if he hadn&#x2019;t been forced to be King when all he really wanted was to draw maps and forge locks had already gotten swaddled in layers and layers of flesh.<br> If he seemed sullen on our wedding night it wasn&#x2019;t so much because he didn&#x2019;t want to share the tart with me. It wasn&#x2019;t even the bed he didn&#x2019;t want to share. It was the life.<br> Sweet smell of orange blossoms mixed with other less intoxicating smells, smoke in the wall hangings, shit in the hallways. Shit, not excrement, for that is how I am, have always been and always will be I adore the vernacular!<br> Lean close to a man and you can smell it on him, no matter how diligently he strives to hide it. Lean close and you can also see a constellation of flea bites on the delicate skin behind the ear, but try to kiss him there just go ahead and try and he&#x2019;ll brush your lips away like you&#x2019;re the flea.<br> Ma petite puce, I teased, practicing my French, and through clenched teeth he replied, Laissez-moi, which I knew enough to know meant Leave me alone. Not even a flicker of humor, or that widening of the wings of the nostrils that, in my brother Karl at least, always meant he was suppressing a laugh. I crooked a finger and began to scratch first one bite, then another, until I had him moaning with pleasure. Louder, I prompted, because of course I knew they were all there, the Queen&#x2019;s Guard and a thousand revelers, laughing and drinking and fornicating on the other side of the Bull&#x2019;s Eye window, waiting for some sign that the Dauphin wasn&#x2019;t, to use his grandfather&#x2019;s phrase, a laggard in the service of Aphrodite.&#x201d; In those days I was also compared to Hebe, Psyche, Antiope, Flora, and Minerva, though in the case of the last less due to her braininess than the way she started life as one colossal headache.<br> Eventually I drew blood. Voilr! I said. Just a measly drop or two but once the court laundresses spread the word, let the court gossips draw their own conclusions.<br><br>Envelope<br><br>Twenty-eight by thirty-four toises. Thirty-two by forty. Invite carriages into the courtyard. No! Keep the horses out . . .<br> It was an endearing quality of the Sun King that he couldn&#x2019;t make up his mind.<br> From the beginning, of course, he knew he wanted Versailles to be the hub of the universe, and that the original chateau, a modest brick hunting lodge&#x201d; built to provide his father with the ideal setting (i.e. as far from his wife as possible) for post-hunt parties and amorous adventures, was really much too small.<br> On this point Louis XIV and his advisors were in perfect accord: the hub of the universe had to be a whole lot bigger. Where they hit a snag, however, was in determining the limits of filial devotion: just because he was Sun King, the advisors pointed out, didn&#x2019;t mean his sentimentality should be given free rein, particularly if it meant trying to find some way to cram his father&#x2019;s chateau into the heart of the new building like a precious jewel,&#x201d; rather than tear it down like the architectural catastrophe everyone agreed it was. Tear it down? Louis roared. Am-poss-EEE-bluh! But to have to build around the old chateau would be like building around a sinkhole in a bog, the advisors whined.<br> It was May 1668. The Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle had just been signed and, as usual after signing a treaty, the Sun King was filled with a deep need either to start another war or begin building a monument to his own brilliance. At such moments he couldn&#x2019;t be stopped. Go ahead and try tearing my father&#x2019;s house down, he replied. As fast as you do, I&#x2019;ll be rebuilding it, brick by brick and stone by stone. At which point the advisors gave up. Okay, they said. Keep the stupid house. Or words to that effect.<br> But when you insist on cleaving to the past, no matter how enchanted your memory of it might be (through the window a round white moon and a white spray of stars and swaying among the silver branches of the lindens hundreds of yellow lanterns, and a beautiful woman with round white breasts swinging to and fro on a golden swing, playing a lute and singing, il y a longtemps que je t&#x2019;aime, over and over, t&#x2019;aime t&#x2019;aime, as the horses whinny and stamp their hooves on the marble paving stones and the nightingales go chook chook chook . . .) you have to endlessly revise the present to accommodate it.<br> Construction began in October; the following June the King wrote a memorandum. His Majesty wishes to make use of everything newly made,&#x201d; he said, by which he evidently meant that having at last seen what the beautiful and the ugly looked like sewn together (to paraphrase Saint- Simon), he&#x2019;d changed his mind and wanted the old chateau razed to the ground.<br> But Kings are almost never left to their own devices, and Louis was lucky enough to have Jean-Baptiste Colbert as his Overseer of Buildings. Colbert, like many cold-blooded people (his emblem was a grass snake), understood the value of collaboration. Immediately he called in his fiddlers three Le Vau, Le Brun, and d&#x2019;Orbay and together they came up with the idea of the Envelope, a revolutionary design that sprawled in ...</p><h2>Cooking Comically: Recipes So Easy You&#39;ll Actually Make Them</h2><p><b>This is not your grandma&#x2019;s cookbook. </b><br><br>Cooking should be as much fun as reading a comic book.

But this is also the story of the maturing process of a young girl during those shattering times. Despite an aloof and insensitive father, a circle of friends that is continually decimated by deportations, and the abrupt ending of a timid first love relationship, she is able to draw strength from the trivial and small pleasures of daily living.</p><p>The Author: Elizabeth Welt Trahan, born in Berlin, Germany, in 1924, lived in Moravsk� Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, from 1929 to 1939, and in Vienna until her departure for the United States in 1947. With degrees from Sarah Lawrence, Cornell, and Yale, she taught at the universities of Massachusetts and Pittsburgh, the Monterey Institute of International Studies and, until 1993, Amherst College. Her publications include textbooks, translations, studies in German, Russian, and comparative literature, and translation and interpretation methodology. Currently, she is the book review editor of <i>The Independent Scholar</i>. She lives in Amherst, MA.�A wonderfully perceptive and detailed 'walk' into the past. Trahan's intelligence and humor create an exceptional picture of Jewish life in Vienna, always under the threat of Gestapo raids and deportations, and seen through the eyes of a young girl growing up.� (Geoffrey Hartman, Yale University)<br> �'Walking with Ghosts' presents a little-known variant on survival in the era of the Holocaust. Elizabeth Trahan describes what it meant to be a teenager living on the edge between legality and illegality in a constantly shrinking group of young people with the same fate and under the threat of death literally to the last minutes of the war. This panorama of a world unknown to many is an unforgettable memoir and an important historical document.� (Sigrid Bauschinger, University of Massachusetts)<br> �The book is very moving, exciting, sad, and yet uplifting, consoling &#x2013; not only by its happy ending, but also because of its perspective and tone.� (Walter H. Sokel, Professor Emeritus, University of Virginia)<br> �I am reading your book and am impressed and touched...� (Elie Wiesel, Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities, Boston University)<br> �This autobiographical narrative evokes the complexities, ironies, desperations and long drawn-out sufferings of those who existed at the margins of the Nazi terror &#x2013; 'foreign Jews' and 'half-Jews' whom the regime trapped more gradually. ...What makes this book valuable is the sober honesty with which it tries to probe the ghosts of the past for a shadow of final truth.� (Kristin Herzog, Newsletter, Independent Scholars' Association, North Carolina Triangle)<br> �This remarkable memoir is an astounding document to round out our knowledge of the Holocaust years by one of a handful of Jews who spent the war years in Vienna and survived. ... The contrast between the sheer youthful desire to live and the reality of danger, war and devastation is rendered simply and perceptively. There is much for the reader to learn about a special time and place and about what it is like to be young.� (Erika Bourguignon, The Antioch Review)</p><h2>Knowledge of The Higher Worlds (and It&#39;s Attainment)</h2><p>Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and its Attainment constitutes a fundamental guide to the anthropological path of cognition or knowledge. In human consciousness, faculties are sleeping that, if awakened, lead to life-giving wisdom. With great clarity and warmth Rudolf Steiner details the exercises and moral qualities to be cultivated on the path to a conscious experience of super-sensible realities.</p><p>Rudolf Steiner (25/27 February, 1861 &#x2013; 30 March, 1925) was an Austrian philosopher, social reformer, architect, and esotericist. He gained initial recognition as a literary critic and cultural philosopher. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he founded a spiritual movement, anthroposophy, as an esoteric philosophy with roots in German idealist philosophy and theosophy. When he was nine years old, he believed he saw the spirit of an aunt who had died in a far-off town asking him to help her; at the time of the vision neither he, nor his family supposedly knew of the woman's death. In contrast to mainstream Theosophy, he sought to build a Western approach to spirituality based on the philosophical and mystical traditions of European culture. The German Section of the Theosophical Society grew rapidly under Steiner's leadership as he lectured throughout much of Europe on his spiritual science. During this period, he maintained an original approach, replacing Madame Blavatsky's terminology with his own, and basing his spiritual research and teachings upon the Western esoteric and philosophical tradition. This and other differences, in particular Steiner's vocal rejection of Leadbeater and Besant's claim that Jiddu Krishnamurti was the vehicle of a new Maitreya, or world teacher, led to a formal split in 1912/13, when Steiner and the majority of members of the German section of the Theosophical Society broke off to form a new group, the Anthroposophical Society.</p><h2>Savage Worlds: Rifts�: Savage Foes of North America (Hardback)(S2P11202LE)</h2><p>IN A WORLD FULL OF MONSTERS AND MADNESS, IT S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT S COMING.

The scientists of the First Foundation had proved victorious; and now they retum to Hari Seldon's long-established plan to build a new Empire that the Second Foundation is not destroyed after all-and that its still-defiant survivors are preparing their revenge. Now the two exiled citizens of the Foundation-a renegade Councilman and the doddering historian-set out in search of the mythical planet Earth. . .and proof that the Second Foundation still exists. Meanwhile someone-or something-outside of both Foundations sees to be orchestrating events to suit its own ominous purpose. Soon representatives of both the First and Second Foundations will find themselves racing toward a mysterious world called Gaia and a final shocking destiny at the very end of the universe!<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Isaac Asimov, world maestro of science fiction, was born in Russia near Smolensk in 1920 and was brought to the United States by his parents three years later. He grew up in Brooklyn where he went to grammar school and at the age of eight he gained his citizen papers. A remarkable memory helped him finish high school before he was sixteen. He then went on to Columbia University and resolved to become a chemist rather than follow the medical career his father had in mind for him. He graduated in chemistry and after a short spell in the Army he gained his doctorate in 1949 and qualified as an instructor in biochemistry at Boston University School of Medicine where he became Associate Professor in 1955, doing research in nucleic acid. Increasingly, however, the pressures of chemical research conflicted with his aspirations in the literary field, and in 1958 he retired to full-time authorship while retaining his connection with the University. Asimov&#39;s fantastic career as a science fiction writer began in 1939 with the appearance of a short story, `Marooned Off Vesta&#39;, in Amazing Stories. Thereafter he became a regular contributor to the leading SF magazines of the day including Astounding, Astonishing Stories, Super Science Stories and Galaxy. He won the Hugo Award four times and the Nebula Award once. With nearly five hundred books to his credit and several hundred articles, Asimov&#39;s output was prolific by any standards. Apart from his many world-famous science fiction works, Asimov also wrote highly successful detective mystery stories, a four-volume History of North America, a two-volume Guide to the Bible, a biographical dictionary, encyclopaedias, textbooks and an impressive list of books on many aspects of science, as well as two volumes of autobiography. Isaac Asimov died in 1992 at the age of 72.<b>Prologue<br><br></b>The First Galactic Empire was falling. It had been decaying and breaking down for centuries and only one man fully realized that fact.<br><br>He was Han Seldon, the last great scientist of the First Empire, and it was he who perfected psychohistory-the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations.<br><br>The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs, Seldon found, could be treated statistically. The larger the mob, the greater the accuracy that could be achieved. And the size of the human masses that Seldon worked with was no less than the population of all the inhabited millions of worlds of the Galaxy.<br><br>Seldon's equations told him that, left to itself, the Empire would fall and that thirty thousand years of human misery and agony would elapse before a Second Empire would arise from the ruins. And yet, if one could adjust some of the conditions that existed, that Interregnum could be decreased to a single millennium-just one thousand years.<br><br>It was to insure this that Seldon set up two colonies of scientists that he called "Foundations." With deliberate intention, he set them up "at opposite ends of the Galaxy." The First Foundation, which centered on physical science, was set up in the full daylight of publicity. The existence of the other, the Second Foundation, a world of psychohistorical and "mentalic" scientists, was drowned in silence.<br><br>In The Foundation Trilogy, the story of the first four centuries of the Interregnum is told. The First Foundation (commonly known as simply "The Foundation," since the existence of another was unknown to almost all) began as a small community lost in the emptiness of the Outer Periphery of the Galaxy. Periodically it faced a crisis in which the variables of human intercourse-and of the social and economic currents of the time-constricted about it. Its freedom to move lay along only one certain line and when it moved in that direction, a new horizon of development opened before it. All had been planned by Han Seldon, long dead now.<br><br>The First Foundation, with its superior science, took over the barbarized planets that surrounded it. It faced the anarchic warlords who broke away from the dying Empire and beat them. It faced the remnant of the Empire itself under its last strong Emperor and its last strong general-and beat it.<br><br>It seemed as though the "Seldon Plan" was going through smoothly and that nothing would prevent the Second Empire from being established on timeand with a minimum of intermediate devastation..<br><br>But psychohistory is a statistical science. Always there is a small chance that something will go wrong, and something did-something which Han Seldon could not have foreseen. One man, called the Mule, appeared from nowhere. He had mental powers in a Galaxy that lacked them. He could mold men's emotions and shape their minds so that his bitterest opponents were made into his devoted servants. Armies could not, would not, fight him. The First Foundation fell and Seldon's Plan seemed to lie in ruins.<br><br>There was left the mysterious Second Foundation, which had been caught unprepared by the sudden appearance of the Mule, but which was now slowly working out a counterattack. Its great defense was the fact of its unknown location. The Mule sought it in order to make his conquest of the Galaxy complete. The faithful of what was left of the First Foundation sought it to obtain help.<br><br>Neither found it. The Mule was stopped first by the action of a woman, Bayta Darell, and that bought enough time for the Second Foundation to organize the proper action and, with that, to stop the Mule permanently. Slowly they prepared to reinstate the Seldon Plan.<br><br>But, in a way, the cover of the Second Foundation was gone. The First Foundation knew of the Second's existence, and the First did not want a future in which they were overseen by the mentalists. The First Foundation was the superior in physical force, while the Second Foundation was hampered not only by that fact, but by being faced by a double task: it had not only to stop the First Foundation but had also to regain its anonymity.<br><br>This the Second Foundation, under its greatest "First Speaker," Preem Palver, managed to do. The First Foundation was allowed to seem to win, to seem to defeat the Second Foundation, and it moved on to greater and greater strength in the Galaxy, totally ignorant that the Second Foundation still existed.<br><br>It is now four hundred and ninety-eight years after the First Foundation had come into existence.

Einstein, the most brilliant man who lived, regularly forgot his shoes and never learned to drive. Hitler possibly has a Jewish ancestor. Picasso avoided paying restaurant bills by doodling on their napkins instead. Prepared to be shocked, amused, and outraged at what they didn&#x2019;t teach you in high school.</p><p><b>Phil Mason</b> has amassed one of the world&#x2019;s largest private collections of cuttings and books chronicling bizarre stories. He is the author of Mission Accomplished! and How George Washington Fleeced the Nation. He lives in England.Mason, who rose to fame for tackling Napoleon's hemorrhoids, has fashioned himself into something of a historical tattler. Washington's big sin, it seems, was a carelessness with money, both his own and the nation's, and a greed for land that occasionally flouted the law. Amid the myth-busting "other little secrets" are tales of a cancer battle that left President Cleveland with a rubber jaw and the assertion that Lyndon Johnson was involved with the Kennedy assassination. Some stories included here are not quite as airbrushed as Mason may think; Hitler's Jewish ancestry and JFK's chronic womanizing are not exactly secrets. Still, there are mysteries to ponder and images to be shattered. Readers' eyebrows may rise at some of Mason's assertions; for instance, if his claims about Mahatma Gandhi are accurate, the world was duped into believing a well-crafted myth about a power-hungry narcissist. Few illustrious names are spared; even the innocuous Louis Pasteur is scrutinized for stealing the formula for a sheep vaccine from another scientist. It's a diverting read, and whether or not these tales are true or turn out to be myths themselves, Mason has crafted a provocative collection of secrets. (Sept.)

As a reporter he found early success covering not only Broadway but also the Mexican Revolution, World War I, the Lindbergh kidnapping and the worlds of professional boxing and baseball. Runyon did not only record the American myth; he helped to create it with his short stories of small-time gamblers and gangsters, drawn directly from the underworld characters he was familiar with. After his death, a collection of his stories became the musical &#34;Guys and Dolls&#34;. Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jimmy Breslin helps to recapture the 1920s era in this book that includes the characters of Pancho Villa, William Randolph Hearst, Al Capone, Jimmy Walker and Jack Dempsey.</p><p>The life of the mythic, wealthy journalist/short-story writer of the Broadway classic Guys and Dolls, told by the legendary, wealthy journalist/novel writer of Table Money, World Without End, Amen, etc. Making some allowances, this book is like Hemingway on Shakespeare. At first Breslin's bragging--making the reader brilliantly aware that the Breslin Mouth is equal to its subject-- is off-putting. But as his Runyon anecdotes gather force, we slowly grasp that Breslin's self-esteem is tested to the breaking point by this portrait of a figure even more legendary and cynically witty in his day than Breslin himself. The Runyon/Breslin team on the page is, with its fruity richness of newsroom lore, simply overwhelming, better than Runyon's buddy Gene Fowler on John Barrymore in Good Night, Sweet Prince, with Breslin tailoring Runyon's every word and move to cut the most--well, Shakespearean- -figure possible. This Runyon with all his invented dialogue must be a fiction--but so what when the page is drugged with such high humor? Runyon at eight cut his teeth as his father's printer's devil in the western states, at 15 was on his own as a wandering reporter. He was a shy, quiet poet with a withering view of mankind--and also a man of warm fellowship with murderers, gamblers, and criminals who fed him the life in his copy and later became his fictional characters. Breslin excels at creating the mirror-reversed moral world of criminals, with the reader, like Alice, on a Broadway of monsters ruled by Runyon, their re-creator in print--people who later become Runyonesques by choice. Companion to Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein, Jack Dempsey, Babe Ruth, and Walter Winchell, and William Randolph Hearst's highest-paid sportswriter and war-reporter, Runyon never bit the hand that fed him--which included many, many hands, only some of them legitimate. Breslin's best--and more impressive in its sustained cynicism than Runyon's own writing. Could live forever. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>This biography of the hellraising journalist Runyon, written by another hellraising reporter, reads a lot like one of Runyon's short stories. Although a popular and widely read journalist, Runyon became famous for his fiction depicting gangster life on Broadway in the 1920s and 1930s. From the stories came the film Little Miss Marker with Shirley Temple, and the musical Guys and Dolls . Breslin, author of numerous books and a long-time New Yorker, knows the territory well. His book is sprinkled with scenes of the colorful lifestyle that was glamorized in Runyon's short stories. Although Breslin's affection and appreciation for Runyon shine through, his view is not an uncritical one. We see Runyon and his times, warts and all.

Television&nbsp;didn't exist and&nbsp;movies were novelties. Entertainment took the form&nbsp;of literature, music, and&nbsp;theatre. During this golden age of Broadway, actors and actresses became legends and starred in now classic plays. Laurence Olivier, Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontaine were names to remember, etching plays&nbsp;into memory&nbsp;as they brought the words of Tennessee Williams or Eugene O'Neill to life.

He lives in Manhattan.Chapter One&nbsp;Lightnin' Has Struck!&nbsp;When Frank Bacon left school at the age of fourteen, his native California counted more jobs to fill than skilled labor qualified to fill them. If not exactly the anarchic frontier of legend, California in the 1880s nevertheless offered opportunity to anyone with--as they put it then--gumption. Young Bacon tried sheepherding, advertising soliciting, and newspaper editing, and even ran an unsuccessful campaign for the state assembly. Then he fell into acting.&nbsp;It was easy to do at the time, for people went to theatre then almost as casually as they turn on the television today, and playhouses were literally everywhere. Some were operated by resident repertory troupes, the "stock" companies that sustained public interest with a constantly changing bill. Certain theatres in a given region were linked to form "wheels" of companies not resident but traveling as wholes from one house to another every six weeks or so; unlike the stock companies, who played everything, the wheels played host to certain genres, for instance in thrill melodrama or society comedy.&nbsp;The expansion of the railroad doomed stock and eventually closed down the wheels, for now the "combination" troupe dominated the national stage: one unit of actors giving a single work and touring with all the necessary sets and costumes. A success in this line meant moving from one theatre to the next (with perhaps a hiatus in summer) for months or even years. Along with bookings in small towns and provincial capitals lay the possibility of an extended run in Chicago or New York.&nbsp;Bacon ended up in one of the last stock companies, in San Jose, for seventeen years, during which he is alleged to have assumed over six hundred roles. One sort of character in particular seems to have caught his interest--the uneducated rustic, innocent of fancy fashion, who somehow gets the better of popinjays and rogues. It was a national stereotype, just then reaching its apex in the career of the third Joseph Jefferson (acting was a family trade), especially in Rip Van Winkle (1866). During his galley years in San Jose, Bacon envisioned a vehicle for his own version of the trope, a small-time hotelier named Bill Jones and ironically nicknamed "Lightnin'" for his life tempo, as slow as paste and a kind of objective correlative for his low-key yet fierce sense of independence. No one crowds Bill Jones. "Lightnin'" has wife troubles, money troubles, and to every question a set of deadpan retorts that exasperate all those in the vicinity yet--Bacon hoped--amuse the public. "Lightnin'"'s hotel straddles the California-Nevada border, the state line running through the middle of the lobby: so women can shield their reputations by claiming to be on holiday in California while more truly seeking one of those quickie Nevada divorces.&nbsp;Bacon called his play The Divided House,* and found no takers. Were managers--the contemporary term for "producers"--leery of a character that had held the stage for over a century, or did Bacon fail to set him off properly?&nbsp;By 1912, Bacon had made it to New York, then as now the goal of virtually any working actor; but Bacon's New York was vaudeville or plays of no professional importance. Now forty-eight, he had been acting for twenty-two years and had every reason to assume that he would never be anything more than one of the many who got a modest living out of it but made no mark.&nbsp;And then Bacon happened to tell the extremely successful playwright Winchell Smith about The Divided House, and how nobody wanted it, and how Bacon had sold it to the movies.&nbsp;"Buy it back," said Smith. He then rewrote Bacon's script, and with manager John Golden opened it at the Gaiety Theatre (at the southwest corner of Broadway and Forty-sixth Street, now demolished) on August 26, 1918. The renamed Lightnin' was a smash. In fact, Bacon was the star and co-author of the biggest hit that Broadway had had to that time. More important, it was general belief that Frank Bacon was Lightnin'. Critics likened his warmth and "business" to that of Joseph Jefferson--who also had had to apply to an extremely successful playwright, Dion Boucicault, for assistance before his Rip Van Winkle went over.&nbsp;Up to Lightnin', the record for a New York run belonged to J. Hartley Manners, whose Peg O' My Heart (1912) held New York for about twenty months. Three other titles (A Trip To Chinatown [1891], Adonis [1884], and The Music Master [1904]) trailed Peg by a month or so. Lightnin' played New York for three years, and, had Bacon got his way, he would have led every single performance. Eventually persuaded to take a vacation, Bacon spent it in the Gaiety Theatre watching his replacement, Milton Nobles, who was getting in shape to head the first national company.&nbsp;It was as though Bacon feared even momentary separation from the individualizing event of his life. He was a husband and father, yes: who wasn't, in those days? But in Lightnin', Bacon had created something typical yet unique, a play made of hokum that seemed the most honest good time the public ever had. And as Bill Jones, Bacon topped even Joseph Jefferson perhaps, and he could look forward to playing the show he so loved up and down the country for the rest of his working life. Indeed, they had had no little trouble auditioning Bacon's successor; Nobles was something like seventy, coaxed out of retirement to save the day.&nbsp;We must get the measure of Lightnin' if we are to organize our perspective on how Broadway's Golden Age began: what it invented but also what it eliminated, because Bill Jones was one of the casualties. In a prologue and three acts, the play moves from the hotel to a courtroom and back, and the plot involves the usual bad guys' attempt to execute a swindle, the objective being Jones' hotel. The good guy is the young lawyer (Ralph Morgan, brother of Frank Morgan, the Wizard of Oz in the 1939 movie) determined to unmask the bad guys; he is also The Boy, and The Girl is the Joneses' foster daughter (Beatrice Nichols). She is loyal to Mrs. Jones (Jessie Pringle), who seeks to divorce Bill, complicating the young romance.&nbsp;All ends well, though the show gets by on no more plot than that. Lightnin' seeks entertainment entirely in Bill Jones' personality, so it's odd to note that it's one of the shortest lead roles ever. Like Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom, Bill makes a great deal out of relatively brief stage time--not in the Big Effect but in the now lost art of underplaying. The aim is to give a detached and casual reading, to take all emotion way down to a point of intimacy between the performer and a public that, denied today's microphoned overstatement, must concentrate.&nbsp;The object of all this attention is a ne'er-do-well drunk who drives everybody crazy by letting nothing perturb him. He's uncooperative, as here when one of the bad guys, Mr. Thomas, comes in:&nbsp;thomas: (beckoning Bill to him) Oh, Bill, I want to see you for a minute.&nbsp;bill: Can't you see me from there?&nbsp;He's a smart alec:&nbsp;bill: Came out [to the West] during the gold excitement.&nbsp;harper: The gold excitement was back in '49.&nbsp;bill: Well, they was still excited when I got here.&nbsp;He's not paying attention even when things of value are at stake, as when he takes over questioning the other bad guy, Mr. Hammond, during the trial scene:&nbsp;bill: Who controls the Golden Gate Land Company?&nbsp;hammond: (lying) I don't know.&nbsp;bill: Don't you know it's controlled by you and Mr. Thomas?&nbsp;thomas: Your Honor, I object!&nbsp;bill: And that all your stock's in the name of rummies?&nbsp;the young lawyer: (correcting him in a stage whisper) Dummies! Dummies!&nbsp;bill: Dummies! Dummies!&nbsp;Worst of all, you name it and he's done it, which makes all of life's striving a fantasy, a jest. Buffalo Bill? "I learned him all he knew about killing Indians." Detectives? "I used to be a detective." Even bees can be claimed for Bill's curriculum vitae:&nbsp;bill: I used to be in the bee business. Why, I drove a swarm of bees across the plains in the dead of winter. (Audience titters.) And never lost a bee. (Audience laughs full out. Bacon lets the laughter die to twenty percent while staring at the other player. Then:) Got stung twice. (Audience roars.)&nbsp;It's like a humorous version of Bacon's own odd-jobbing past.&nbsp;But isn't that the point? The white-haired Bacon, in his rumpled jacket and tie and battered hat, made no stab at notching Bill up for charm. Bill was what he was, a loser having a good time. So Bacon wasn't Lightnin'. Bacon was a "barely made it" who never stopped struggling to get there. A striver. In an age of matinee idols, professional Brits, Heavy Fathers,* light comics, and Shakespeareans, Frank Bacon was almost not an actor. Not a type: because his type was all but retired by 1900 or so. One can only imagine how proud and relieved Bacon must have been to play his character in his style and make such a hit out of it.&nbsp;He might easily have failed, with such superannuated material. It's flattering to be compared to one of the great names of the past; is it good for business? Jefferson enjoyed a very long career, but he was born the year that President Andrew Jackson took office. That's an awfully old tradition to be a part of. Then, too, Bacon didn't just look rumpled and battered: he was, having lived at the bottom of a profession made of two distinct social groups--one, big stars; and, two, everyone else. By chance, Bacon's arrival in New York in 1912 coincided with the formation of Actors Equity, a group determined to reform managerial abuses.&nbsp;These were, frankly, astonishing. In a time when a hit show played most of its run in weekly bookings around the country for one or two years, it was perhaps no more than unhappy that a production might close with the cast stranded many miles from home. It could be called regrettable that managers did not pay actors for the extra performances added on during holidays.* But it is simply unbelievable that rehearsals--which lasted as long as the manager wanted them to--went entirely unpaid. How on earth did the penniless see themselves through a rehearsal period? As it was, Equity sought no more than half salary for rehearsals, along with certain other modest concessions.&nbsp;The Producing Managers Association had every reason to resist, because the actors were powerless. True, the stars weren't--but why would stars make common cause with grunts? The two groups dwelled on separate planets. The thespian solidarity that exists among actors today is relatively new, in part based on the development of the integrated acting ensemble, in which leads and support alike see themselves as working within a single entity. Ensemble acting did not exist in 1919: production tilted the room, as Hollywood now phrases it, toward the star. Everybody else was infinitely replaceable.&nbsp;But something happened in around 1915. For some reason--probably the lower-middle-class acculturation of cinema and a concomitant falloff in playgoers' ticketbuying--the road began to close down. True, not till the late 1920s could one say that the road Just Wasn't What It Was; not till the 1950s was it genuinely vanishing; not till the 1960s was it gone but for the odd tour of some recent Broadway hit or a classic wrapped in a star package. Still, by 1915 the average actor's life had changed from difficult to impossible.&nbsp;And something else happened. While many of the stars believed that theatre was a privileged profession, art rather than commerce, and were thus hostile to joining a labor union, other stars declared themselves absolutely in sympathy with Equity and its agenda. Some of them had come up the hard way, like Frank Bacon, and viewed with compassion those who were still struggling. Some held that theatre was made not by managers but by actors, and saw in that notion a dislocation of the makers' right to profit. And some of them simply knew fair from unfair. The managers were unfair, and I mean to a man.&nbsp;So the acting profession was divided, and that made the managers feel secure. Unions serve the drudge, the work horse. Actors were dolls, and Equity was nonsense. The very business of American theatre was founded on a lack of equity: on the manager's more or less coddling his stars and exploiting the grunts. At that, few actors belonged to Equity in the first place. What was Equity going to do, strike? Pull out a couple of First Gravediggers? Besides, the tyrant of vaudeville, Edward F. Albee (grandfather of the playwright), faced his own strike in 1916, and not only did he crush the strike: he blacklisted its leaders.&nbsp;Nevertheless, by the summer of 1919, having continually failed even to get recognition from the Producing Managers Association, Equity was seriously contemplating a strike. The timing could not have been worse, for 1919 was a year of social unrest and extremely unpopular labor actions. Beginning on January 21, a general strike in Seattle, believed to be the result of agitation by the radical Industrial Workers of the World, was defeated only by ferocious resistance from Mayor Ole Hanson, backed by the police and the army. On the other hand, a five-day strike of telephone operators in Boston starting on April 15 that froze communication throughout most of New England found almost all the public in sympathy with the strikers. These women put in long days deftly maneuvering in complex operations for very low pay. Wasn't their situation comparable to that of the actors?&nbsp;However, the rest of that spring saw not just labor actions but the mailing of bombs disguised as packages from Gimbel's department store and the planting of bombs on the doorsteps of officials' houses. Through blind luck and the vigilance of one postal clerk, the mailings claimed but one casualty, blowing off the hands of Senator Thomas R. Hardwick's black maid; and the second terrorist wave took out only the front of Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer's house and the terrorist himself.*&nbsp;Another problem was that no one, in or out of Equity, knew even vaguely how an actors' strike would fare when something like one-third of the stars were pro-union, one-third anti-union, and one-third waiting to see what happened. If a star went on but the support struck his show, would understudies scab for an opportunity? How would the public react to being shut out of its most basic form of entertainment? Would the managers blacklist ringleaders, in the Albee manner? In fact, the managers thought the actors too uncertain and infantile to do more than talk strike. "I honestly didn't think," said George M. Cohan's producing partner, Sam H. Harris, "the boys would go so far."&nbsp;Because they did strike. It started on the evening of August 6, in utter confusion. Some actors struck and some didn't. Some managers did send understudies on, but some understudies struck. Some stars prepared to walk, then changed their minds. Some stars refused to walk, learned that the theatre across the street was going dark that night, and promptly led their companies out into the night.

Instead of being only a propagation of the holy bloodline, the Rex Deus families are also carriers of the secret teachings of Jesus.</p><p><i>Custodians of Truth</i> reveals the purpose and secrets of the Rex Deus lineage. Jesus was not only a holy man, but an adept of ancient knowledge, which informed his own teachings. This secret knowledge was suppressed by the Church in their voracious quest for power and influence in the secular world. These teachings have manifested throughout history in different forms--Gnostic philosophy around the time of Jesus, the Order of the Knights Templar, Freemasons, and the current resurgence of interest in New Age thought. Finally, the time is right for the hidden message of Jesus to be revealed--a message of tolerance, brotherhood, and respect for nature.</p><p>The next chapter in the legend of the Holy Grail and the bloodline of Christ-from the best-selling authors of Rosslyn.</p></p><p><p>Tim Wallace-Murphy is an author and lecturer with an international reputation. He is the driving force behind the creation of the European Templar Heritage Research Network and author of <i>Rosslyn</i> and <i>The Mark of the Beast</i>.</p>In this second collaboration, Wallace-Murphy and Hopkins continue a quest begun in their first work, <i>Rex Deus</i>. This similarly themed sophomore effort finds them making a case for identifying the Holy Grail as the bloodline of Jesus Christ and portraying subsequent efforts to protect that lineage throughout history. They claim to have been contacted by a man known only as Michael, who claims to be a descendant of Jesus Christ and a custodian of the secret of the Grail. To support their thesis, the authors recast biblical history as a vast coverup, an ingenious story concocted by priests and plotters. They continue with a narrative of church and state conspiring to maintain the secret of the Grail, beginning with the early church, through the Middle Ages and finally to the present day. To accept the authors' premise, one must consent to the idea of a massive coverup, a cabal involving church, various governments and science. Furthermore, one must agree that Jesus survived the crucifixion and lived on to raise his children and produce a family line. Drawing heavily from known secondary sources, this book offers little that is new, but rather a rehash of much that has already been published and has been heavily popularized through the novel <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>. It does, however, provide a readable&#x2014;if fervent&#x2014;overview of this controversial theory. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Wells&#39; revolutionary human rights manifesto is reissued by Penguin with a new introduction by fellow novelist and human rights campaigner Ali Smith &#39;Penguin and Pelican Specials are books of topical importance published within as short a time as possible from receipt of the manuscript. Some are reprints of famous books brought up-to-date, but usually they are entirely new books published for the first time.&#39; H. G. Wells wrote The Rights of Man in 1940, partly in response to the ongoing war with Germany. The fearlessly progressive ideas he set out were instrumental in the creation of the UN&#39;s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the EU&#39;s European Convention on Human Rights and the UK&#39;s Human Rights Act. When first published, this manifesto was an urgently topical reaction to a global miscarriage of justice. It was intended to stimulate debate and make a clear statement of mankind&#39;s immutable responsibilities to itself. Seventy-five years have passed and once again we face a humanitarian crisis. In the UK our human rights are under threat in ways that they never have been before and overseas peoples are being displaced from their homelands in their millions. The international community must act decisively, cooperatively and fast. The Rights of Man is not an &#39;entirely new book&#39; - but it is a book of topical importance and it has been published, now as before, in as short a time as possible, in order to react to the sudden and urgent need. With a new introduction by award-winning novelist and human rights campaigner Ali Smith, Penguin reissues one of the most important humanitarian texts of the twentieth century in the hope that it will continue to stimulate debate and remind our leaders - and each other - of the essential priorities and responsibilities of mankind.</p><p>H.G. Wells was a professional writer and journalist who published more than a hundred books, including pioneering science fiction novels, histories, essays and programmes for world regeneration. He was a founding member of numerous movements including Liberty and PEN International - the world&#39;s oldest human rights organization - and his Rights of Man laid the groundwork for the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Wells&#39; controversial and progressive views on equality and the shape of a truly developed nation remain directly relevant to our world today.excerpt from the Introduction by Ali Smith<br><br>. . . . <br><br>H. G. Wells wrote several classic, visionary novels about the very worst consequences a past and a present can have on a future &#x2013; and a great deal of what he wrote, though it takes fantasy form, has come to pass, with stunning corollaries with his own time, the time after him, with our own time, and presumably with the as-yet-unwritten time ahead of us too.<br>&nbsp;<br>So. What did the socialist visionary, the great, very human, far-seeing man, whose literary rise and circulation in the world had made him exceptionally powerful and exceptionally thoughtful about the workings of power, the man who&#x2019;d been invited to meet and advise both Roosevelt and Stalin, who&#x2019;d worked on ways, in his latter years, to &#x2018;release a new form of power in the world&#x2019;, a power &#x2018;without tyranny&#x2019;, one &#x2018;to hold men&#x2019;s minds together in something like a common interpretation of reality&#x2019; and a real &#x2018;unification of our race&#x2019; and to work for &#x2018;our collective life&#x2019; &#x2013;<br>&nbsp;<br>What could such a profoundly prophetic writer do, who not only knew but drew for us the thin line between fantasy and reality, possibility and impossibility, and who so convincingly, prophetically and repeatedly envisioned the worst possible things that the world, the universe and the human beings in it can do to each other?<br>&nbsp;<br>This.<br>&nbsp;<br>He helped form and sustain PEN, where an internationality of writers would come together and think the world, and fight for and protect each other&#x2019;s freedom to write and freedom to read.<br>&nbsp;<br>He helped form and sustain the National Council for Civil Liberties, we know it now as Liberty, to monitor and fight for the civil liberties that human beings need and that weak or bullying governments who want all the power will always want to mess with.<br>&nbsp;<br>Above all, what we needed to do, Wells believed, was make and ratify as law an international declaration of human rights. In his final years of life, Wells was a core contributor to the Sankey Declaration of the Rights of Man, in fact he was the most active member of its committee, the main drafter of its clauses of fundamental human rights, his versions of which were closely followed in the eventual drafting of the wording for the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights, shortly after Wells&#x2019;s own death in 1946.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our own Human Rights Act finally passed into law as late as 1998, incorporating into British law for the first time the European Convention on Human Rights, protecting human rights all across Europe and ratified by forty-seven member states (in fact, the UK was one of the first countries to ratify it in 1951, supported, especially by Churchill, as a protection against the possible return of fascism). The current government of the UK, now a hundred days old, announced as soon as it took office that it fully intends to scrap the Human Rights Act, that&#x2019;s the word they always use, though God help me I find it an obscenity, those words scrap and human and rights together in any sentence. That&#x2019;s what I call evolution going backwards.<br>&nbsp;<br>But it&#x2019;s okay &#x2013; <i>There is invisible support all around you</i>. Whether Fortuna the online goddess is right or not, Wells was wise enough to call for a much more visible form of support after a lifetime of seeing the dark of the future and the fragility of the light in people&#x2019;s eyes. He had known what it meant, since his first years as a writer, to be human and thought of as somewhat alien. And since 1896, when he was a young man writing <i>The Island of Doctor Moreau</i>, a book all about the beast in the human, he&#x2019;d been interested in how at the mercy of the random or self-serving lawmakers we are. He was in his seventies when he wrote <i>The Rights of Man</i>, &#x2018;using &#x201c;man&#x201d; of course,&#x2019; as he said, &#x2018;to cover every individual male or female, child or adult, of the species&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Knowing too well in 1940 how little the League of Nations had been able to &#x2018;banish armed conflict from the world&#x2019;, he called, in <i>The Rights of Man</i>, for &#x2018;a profound reconstruction of the methods of human living&#x2019;. What are we fighting for? was his question. His answer: &#x2018;a code of fundamental human rights which shall be made easily accessible to everyone&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>His initial draft included most of the things you can still find in our current Human Rights Act, and is especially, and interestingly presciently, strong on rights to privacy and dismissal of secrecy. &#x2018;All registration and records about citizens shall be open to their personal and private inspection. There shall be no secret dossiers in any administrative department.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp;<br>Here are the other suggested rights, in short. Right to nourishment, housing, health care and mental care : right to education : right to have home and private property protected : right to work and earn and be free from slavery : right to move freely about the world : right to public trial and to detention for a short fixed time only : freedom from torture and degrading or inhuman treatment : right not to be force-fed nor stopped from hunger strike if you so choose : and right to finite imprisonment terms.<br>&nbsp;<br>He spends the book tinkering with the precise wordings of these suggested rights, to get it right, because on the one hand, &#x2018;in its thickets&#x2019;, as he puts it, &#x2018;governmental activities can interweave with, and at last become indistinguishable from organized crime&#x2019;. On the other hand, &#x2018;the primary objective of every sane social order is to banish fear . . . from human life&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>Here&#x2019;s the invisible Wells, writing seventy-five years ago:<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The enormous change in human conditions to which nearly all our present stresses are due, the abolition of distance and the stupendous increase in power, have flung together the population of the world so that a new way of living has become imperative . . . The elaboration of methods and material has necessitated a vast development and refinement of espionage, and in addition the increasing difficulty of understanding what the warfare is really about has produced new submersive and demoralizing activities of rumour spreading, propaganda and the like, that complicate and lose contact at last with any rational objective . . . <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The uprooting of millions of people who are driven into exile among strangers, who are forced to seek new homes, produces a peculiar exacerbation of the mental strain. Never have there been such crowds of migrating, depressing people. They talk languages we do not understand . . . They stimulate xenophobia without intention . . . Their necessary discordance with the new populations they invade releases and intensifies the natural distrust and hostility of man for man &#x2013; which it is the aim of all moral and social training to eliminate . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>"For the restoration and modernization of human civilization, this exaggerated outlawing of the fellow citizen whom we see fit to suspect as a traitor or revolutionary and also of the stranger within our gates, has to be restrained and brought back within the scheme of human rights.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Given how familiar all this sounds, it&#x2019;s certainly interesting that our own Human Rights Act is right now under attack. You can read it, and find out about the threat to it, online. Look up Liberty, who&#x2019;ve got a strong Save Our Human Rights Act campaign that needs us all right now. Look up PEN. Look up Amnesty International.<br>&nbsp;<br>The government keeps calling it Labour&#x2019;s Human Rights Act. It&#x2019;s not. It was a cross-party formation, and it&#x2019;s ours, it belongs to all of us. They want to replace it with a British bill of rights &#x2013; as if all nationalities are equal, but some are more equal than others. Wells would have dismissed outright the argument for a British bill of rights in the interest of &#x2018;the claims of the common man&#x2019;, claims &#x2018;against any government that seeks to defeat, exploit or betray&#x2019; those common claims.<br>&nbsp;<br>Back in 1940 he is facing his own &#x2018;incalculable government&#x2019;, and wants one that will &#x2018;declare for these rights unequivocally &#x2013; or get out&#x2019;. To paraphrase him slightly: an act of gross cruelty or injustice that occurs anywhere, wherever it happens, is just as much a British person&#x2019;s concern, a Scottish person&#x2019;s concern, an English person&#x2019;s, an Irish person&#x2019;s, a Welsh person&#x2019;s, a [fill in the blank with a nationality of your choice] person&#x2019;s concern. He knew, as Saramago puts it in his great novel Seeing: &#x2018;rights aren&#x2019;t abstractions, they continue to exist even when they&#x2019;re not respected&#x2019;.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2018;There is no source of law,&#x2019; Wells says, &#x2018;but the whole people, and since life flows on constantly to new citizens, no generation of the people can in whole or in part surrender or delegate the legislative power inherent in mankind.&#x2019; Ah, he was an optimist after all. Ah, there is a heroic in his very human denial of heroes and heroism. There is wildness and revolution in his work, and above all an eye to a future that looks from here to be invisible, but that&#x2019;s always just a stone&#x2019;s throw away.<br>&nbsp;<br>Borges thought Wells&#x2019;s books, especially the early fantastic classics, would last forever, &#x2018;be incorporated, like the fables . . . into the general memory of the species and even transcend . . . the extinction of the language in which they were written&#x2019;. Well, that&#x2019;s a form of very ultimate success. Wells was a bit more short-term about it: &#x2018;The only true measure of success is the ratio between what we might have done and what we might have been on the one hand, and the thing we have made and the things we have made of ourselves, on the other.&#x2019; <br>&nbsp;<br>So. You, me, now, here we are. Here it all is. Here it comes. It&#x2019;s on our watch. (To observe the progress of, maintain an interest in. To have in one&#x2019;s care, to look after, to guard, to tend. From the Old English: to wake.) What&#x2019;ll we stand for? A couple of minutes an hour? Or what we call the future?<br>&nbsp;<br>And on the other hand, what won&#x2019;t we stand for?</p><h2>Must We Divide History Into Periods? (European Perspectives: A Series in Social Thought and Cultural Criticism)</h2><p>We have long thought of the Renaissance as a luminous era that marked a decisive break with the past, but the idea of the Renaissance as a distinct period arose only during the nineteenth century. Though the view of the Middle Ages as a dark age of unreason has softened somewhat, we still locate the advent of modern rationality in the Italian thought and culture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. <br><br>Jacques Le Goff pleads for a strikingly different view. In this, his last book, he argues persuasively that many of the innovations we associate with the Renaissance have medieval roots, and that many of the most deplorable aspects of medieval society continued to flourish during the Renaissance. We should instead view Western civilization as undergoing several "renaissances" following the fall of Rome, over the course of a long Middle Ages that lasted until the mid-eighteenth century. <br><br>While it is indeed necessary to divide history into periods, Le Goff maintains, the meaningful continuities of human development only become clear when historians adopt a long perspective. Genuine revolutions&#x2015;the shifts that signal the end of one period and the beginning of the next&#x2015;are much rarer than we think.</p><p>Jacques Le Goff argues that many of the innovations we associate with the Renaissance have medieval roots, and that many of the most deplorable aspects of medieval society continued to flourish during the Renaissance.

Chatterji&#x2019;s book is a brief introduction to the nature of ultimate reality and the manifestation of the universe according to the Trika System. It also covers, briefly, the history of this advaita Shaiva philosophy of Kashmir. First published in 1914 as the first book in &#x201c;The Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies,&#x201d; it is still the clearest introduction to the Tattvas of the Trika.<br><br>Since the lower twenty-five of the thirty-six Trika Tattvas represent the entire universe from the Samkhya point of view, here also is a very clear exposition of the Samkhya Tattvas. The only difference is that, while the Purusha and the Prakriti are the final realities for Samkhya, they are but derivatives according to the Trika, which, carrying the analysis further, recognizes eleven additional Tattvas above the Purusha.</p><p></p><h2>Murder in Her Stocking (A Granny Reid Mystery)</h2><p><i>As the Moonlight Magnolia Agency revisits old memories on Christmas Eve, Granny Reid takes the reins back thirty years to the 1980s&#x2014;back when she went by Stella, everyone&#x2019;s hair was bigger, and sweaters were colorful disasters.

A young man wandering a nameless path has only a stuffed bear as a companion, which inertly endures his desperation, anger, and musings along the way. The landscape is cold and bleak with few landmarks, and offers only precarious encounters with animals and armed men. These interactions are rife with instinct, the drive for survival, and human ethics concerning the killed and injured. He finds acceptance with a pack of dogs, though their nature is wild and their potential threat is as unsettling as the sudden presence of a massive pipeline on the horizon. In a dreamlike state, the endless land becomes a vast body of water where his boat is destroyed and his body floats in a subconscious space. On land, the road disappears and only blind circumstance remains. All is uncertain and all can be lost, but he continues on regardless.</p></p><p><p><b>ANDERS NILSEN</b> was born in New Hampshire and lives in Chicago. He is the <br>cartoonist behind the award-winning comic book series Big Questions.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> A young man wanders a war-torn tundra accompanied only by a stuffed bear. As he wanders, he encounters various animals and humans who all prove inferior to the lifeless bear as a real companion&#x2014;imaginary friends are the best ones in a world where everyone competes for meager resources. Nilsen has crafted a haunting fable of humanity and loneliness, confronting tropes about journeys and destinations. "I know this whole venture is not about having a goal," he tells the bear at one point. "But doesn't the whole idea of a journey become kind of meaningless if there's not a sense of some destination?" Each encounter is more troubling than the last: a bus shows up but a passenger shoots at the narrator. A pack of reindeer try to steal the bear. In return, the narrator blinds one of the majestic stags with a rock. A human who shows up in the bleak terrain tries to steal the narrator's pack. The narrator is finally accepted by a pack of wild dogs that lives off the remains of both the humans and animals already encountered. Nilsen's open, simple yet graceful art captures the eerie, empty sense of loss that permeates this unsettling, memorable story. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She narrowed her lavender eyes and drew her arm way back as though she were going to throw a spear.<br> <br>Her BFF, Antheia, the goddess of flowering wreaths, turned to watch the sky expectantly. Both goddessgirls were standing out on the Mount Olympus Academy sports fields on a beautiful, happy Sunday.<br> <br>Brrrng! There was a sound like the strum of a harp as Iris hurled what she held in her hand toward the sky. But what she threw wasn&#x2019;t a spear. It was a streaming, gleaming ball of magic! It left her fingers, trailing long flowy ribbons of iridescent colors. When it reached the sky, it curled, looped, and blossomed into a big bouquet of brightly hued flowers all made of light.<br> <br>Other Academy students on the fields looked up, pointed, and smiled at her creation. Antheia jumped up and down, clapping in delight. Her bouncing made the cute wreath of ferns and berries that encircled her straight brown hair like a crown tilt sideways. &#x201c;That was amazing! Do some more,&#x201d; she urged as she straightened her wreath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Iris was tickled pink at her friend&#x2019;s enthusiasm. Literally. Her hair was actually turning various shades of pink, from coral to bubble gum to fuchsia. It often did that, changing color to match her outfit, her mood, or just because. In fact, as she looked around the sports fields now for inspiration, her hair slowly shifted through all the colors of the rainbow, from red to orange to yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, and soft shades of all the colors in between.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm. What should I make?&#x201d; she murmured, tucking her long wavy hair behind her ears. A light breeze had begun to blow across the fields, and the small sparkly pink wings at Iris&#x2019;s back fluttered gently.<br> <br>Just then her gaze fell on the four members of the Goddessgirls Cheer Squad practicing over by the bleachers. Athena, Persephone, Aphrodite, and Artemis were apparently working on new cheers. Many immortal students went to the Academy&#x2014;all of them beautiful, handsome, powerful, and awesome, with softly glittering skin. But these four girls were the most popular of all the goddessgirls at MOA.<br> <br>Athena was the goddess of wisdom and inventions, among other things; Persephone was the goddess of flowers; Aphrodite was the goddess of love and beauty; and Artemis&#x2014;a skilled archer&#x2014;was the goddess of the hunt. And Iris&#x2019;s BFF, of course, was the goddess of flowering wreaths.<br> <br>Lucky them! Seemed like almost all the immortal MOA students were the goddesses or gods of something. However, even though Iris was a goddess, too, she wasn&#x2019;t officially the goddess of anything special. Which was so majorly lame. She loved rainbows and was good at making them. If only Principal Zeus would recognize her special skill and name her the official goddess of rainbows!<br> <br>Well, somehow she was going to make that happen. And that was the reason she&#x2019;d come out to the fields to practice creating different-shaped rainbows this morning.<br> <br>Iris wound up again, then threw. Brrrng! Another ball of magic left her fingers. Streaming colored ribbons of light, it sailed in a high arc overhead to form three huge, gleaming blue-and-gold letters: MOA. Blue-and-gold pom-poms that actually shook appeared around the letters.<br> <br>Aphrodite was the first to notice the colorful letters and pom-poms and pointed them out to her three Cheer Squad besties. All four girls smiled and waved to Iris in thanks.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting better at this,&#x201d; Antheia told Iris. &#x201c;If you ever get a chance to show Principal Zeus what you can do, he&#x2019;s going to be impressed. I just know it!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You think?&#x201d; Iris said uncertainly. &#x201c;I wish I could make my rainbows do something really amazing to show him, though. I mean, they&#x2019;re pretty and all. But to gain Zeus&#x2019;s notice maybe they need to do something worthwhile and practical, too. Something that&#x2019;ll prove I deserve to be Goddess of Rainbows. Like your wreaths&#x2014;they&#x2019;re pretty and useful, since they&#x2019;re worn during ceremonies and used as prizes in the Olympic Games.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Could you get your rainbows to make music? Or fight enemies?&#x201d; Antheia suggested.<br> <br>Iris cocked her head. &#x201c;Actually, I was thinking of using them as transportation. Like a long smooth slide to nearby and faraway places. Wouldn&#x2019;t that be fun?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; said Antheia, her eyes rounding at the exciting notion. &#x201c;It&#x2019;d be awesome. But can you make them strong enough and long enough for riding?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working on it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Goddessgirls Cheer Squad had huddled together after spotting Iris&#x2019;s pom-pom rainbow moments ago. Now they broke apart to do a thank-you cheer for her that they&#x2019;d made up on the spur of the moment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Go, Iris, go!<br> <br>We love your rainbow!<br> <br>Your colors inspire us.<br> <br>You rock, Goddess Iris!&#x201d;<br> <br>Iris grinned and waved back. Antheia laughed and waved too.<br> <br>&#x201c;Make me a trident rainbow for good luck!&#x201d; a boy called out to Iris. It was Poseidon, the godboy of the sea. He was holding up his trident, which was a fancy three-pronged pitchfork that dripped seawater. He and a godboy named Ares were downfield, having a contest to see who could throw the farthest. As Iris watched, Ares chucked his spear halfway down the field, and a roar went up from the boys who&#x2019;d gathered around to cheer both him and Poseidon on.<br> <br>Quickly Iris tossed out some magic and created a trident-shaped rainbow for Poseidon, then a spear rainbow for Ares. More requests came, and she continued making rainbows to represent the sports that different godboys and goddessgirls were doing on the fields. With each new design the other students erupted into whoops and clapping.<br> <br>When she shaped a bow and arrow rainbow in the sky, a boy shouted, &#x201c;Nice!&#x201d; It was the dark-haired, dark-eyed godboy Apollo. He usually practiced archery with his twin sister, Artemis. But since she was doing Cheer, he was practicing with Eros, who was also amazing with a bow and arrow.<br> <br>The golden-winged Eros was concentrating on a distant target now, the string of his bow drawn back. When he released his arrow, it flew straight to the target&#x2019;s heart. Zing! Iris and Antheia watched Apollo punch a fist into the air in approval. Afterward he said something to Eros, then turned and jogged toward the two girls, clutching a rolled-up piece of papyrus in one fist.<br> <br>Iris sensed Antheia&#x2019;s excitement rise and saw her cheeks redden. As would be obvious to anyone, Antheia was blushing. However, only Iris could also see the air around her friend turning a pale rosy-red color. This was an aura, which was sort of a full-body halo. All her life Iris had been able to see colorful auras like this around people, which indicated their emotions or moods. After years of practice, she knew what the different shades of an aura meant. For instance, a deep red one meant embarrassment.<br> <br>However the air around Antheia was turning the kind of pale rosy-red that indicated liking. Uh-oh. Though Iris wasn&#x2019;t as good as Aphrodite at divining who was in like with who, she knew what this particular aura meant. It meant that Antheia hadn&#x2019;t given up on her dream of Apollo becoming her crush. Unfortunately.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was wondering if you&#x2019;d add some decoration to this letterscroll for me,&#x201d; Apollo asked Iris when he reached the two girls. &#x201c;Artemis said you&#x2019;re good at doing fancy decorations. And I wanted this letter to be more colorful, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>Iris wasn&#x2019;t surprised by this request. MOA students often asked her to add colorful flourishes to the borders of special letters, or even to do face-painting at times. She might not have been a fine artist, but her talent with colors extended to special decorative touches. She&#x2019;d added embellishments to lockers, dorm room walls and bulletin boards, and even to secret notescrolls students passed in class or left in someone&#x2019;s locker.<br> <br>She darted a glance at Antheia. Iris was sure that the scroll Apollo held out to her was meant for a mortal princess named Cassandra. Had Antheia guessed this too?<br> <br>Cassandra&#x2019;s family owned the bakery that made Oracle-O fortune cookies in the Immortal Marketplace, which was located below Mount Olympus and had shops that sold everything from the newest Greek fashions to yarn, cosmetics, and thunderbolts. Cassandra&#x2019;s family lived in an apartment above their shop.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi, Apollo,&#x201d; Antheia suddenly piped up in a hopeful voice that was higher than her usual one.<br> <br>Iris groaned silently. That girl just would not give up! She couldn&#x2019;t seem to accept that her dreams of Apollo ever like-liking her were doomed. Everyone knew he was in like with Cassandra. But that fact hadn&#x2019;t stopped Antheia from wishing it could be otherwise.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, hi, Antheia,&#x201d; Apollo replied, looking a little uncomfortable. His aura had turned yellow&#x2013;green, which suggested to Iris that he suspected Antheia&#x2019;s crush but was too cowardly to tell her that he wasn&#x2019;t interested in returning her affection. Godboys were mostly strong and forthright when it came to sports or battle, but crushes were a subject they usually tried to avoid.<br> <br>&#x201c;How about asking Aphrodite to add something cute, instead?&#x201d; Iris suggested to him. &#x201c;Maybe some hearts and stuff. She&#x2019;s the goddess of love after all.&#x201d; If she didn&#x2019;t take the scroll he held out, maybe he&#x2019;d leave quickly so her friend could calm down. Poor Antheia. Iris had tried hinting to her that her fixation on Apollo was impossible, but Antheia just didn&#x2019;t seem to get it. So Iris simply did what she could to discourage her friend&#x2019;s doomed crush. She even pointed out other cute and interesting guys now and then with the hope of steering her toward another boy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, she&#x2019;s busy with Cheer, and I&#x2019;m kind of in a hurry to send this letterscroll to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. someone,&#x201d; said Apollo.<br> <br>Beside her, Antheia looked momentarily elated.<br> <br>Ye gods! thought Iris. Was she actually hoping he meant the scroll for her? This was not good!<br> <br>&#x201c;Hermes should be here any minute,&#x201d; Apollo said. Looking up, his brown eyes scanned the skies for the delivery chariot that flew to MOA at least once every day carrying packages and letters. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m hoping to send my letterscroll to the IM with him.&#x201d; After a slight hesitation and an awkward glance at Antheia, he added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for Cassandra.&#x201d;<br> <br>Instantly Antheia wilted, looking like Apollo had just shot down her hopes with one of his arrows. So she really had been daydreaming that he&#x2019;d planned to give her the letterscroll. Surely she must know better. Still, Iris knew what it was like to hope for something so hard. And with all her heart she wanted to believe that her dream of becoming the goddess of rainbows wasn&#x2019;t as doomed as Antheia&#x2019;s crush on Apollo.<br> <br>Sensing that the insistent godboy wasn&#x2019;t going to give up, Iris gave in and said, &#x201c;Okay, sure, I&#x2019;ll decorate it for you.&#x201d; She took his scroll over to the bleachers near where the Cheer Squad was practicing, while Antheia and Apollo followed. She always carried a set of preloaded colored-ink pens around just in case, and now she whipped them from the bag she&#x2019;d left on the bleachers. She chose three pens&#x2014;a bright blue, a flamingo-pink, and a lime-green.<br> <br>Quickly she unrolled and flattened the scroll facedown on a bench seat so no one could accidentally read the private message on its other side. Then she proceeded to draw a cute border on the outside of the letterscroll with the three different-colored pens at once, adding rainbows, bows and arrows, and swirly flourishes.<br> <br>After a few minutes she glanced over at Apollo, who had been admiring her work. &#x201c;Want me to draw her name on the outside too?&#x201d; Although she was in a hurry for him to go, she wanted to do a good job.<br> <br>Apollo nodded enthusiastically. &#x201c;That would be mega-cool!&#x201d; While he watched Iris form and decorate the letters of Cassandra&#x2019;s name, Antheia stared at him with a besotted expression.<br> <br>Seeming to sense her gaze, he looked over at her. &#x201c;Nice day, huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>Antheia blushed. &#x201c;Um, yeah. For a Sunday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Which didn&#x2019;t really make much sense, thought Iris. Antheia seemed too head over heels in like right now to notice that, though. And she didn&#x2019;t have a chance to say more to him because just then an MOA goddessgirl named Pheme zipped over. She&#x2019;d arrived almost out of nowhere, it seemed, her sandaled feet hovering a few inches above the ground.<br> <br>As she touched down, the small, glittery wings on her back stilled. Iris had always had wings, but Pheme&#x2019;s wings were a recent gift from Principal Zeus, which made them extra special&#x2014;a reward for heroism during a fiery battle. The girl&#x2019;s wings were a cute shade of orange, the same as her lip gloss and short, spiky hair. Iris&#x2019;s wings were cute too, but unlike Pheme&#x2019;s, they were too delicate for flying. Like her rainbows, they were decorative, not functional.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you?&#x201d; Pheme asked Antheia first thing upon landing.<br> <br>Oh no, thought Iris. She must&#x2019;ve noticed how Antheia was mooning over Apollo. Pheme was the goddess of gossip and rumor, so you had to be careful around her. She noticed everything, and telling her anything was the same as shouting it to the whole school!<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing&#x2019;s wrong with her,&#x201d; Iris answered for her suddenly tongue-tied best friend.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on. She&#x2019;s blushing. What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; Pheme was studying Antheia in a super-interested snoopy way now. As always, when the gossipy girl spoke, puffy cloud-letters formed above her head so that anyone who happened to be looking could read her words.<br> <br>Seeking out juicy gossip and sniffing out rumors was sort of like Pheme&#x2019;s job at the Academy. Plus, it gave her material for the gossip column she wrote in Teen Scrollazine, which was a mega-popular &#x2019;zine read by mortals and immortals alike.<br> <br>Iris finished her drawing and stood, handing the letterscroll to Apollo. &#x201c;This is perfect!&#x201d; he proclaimed, smiling down at her work.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s perfect?&#x201d; The Cheer Squad had taken a break, and Artemis had come over to talk to Apollo. She peered at the name on the letterscroll, then rolled her eyes at her brother in a teasing way. &#x201c;For your crush, I see.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What of it?&#x201d; said Apollo, blushing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to read it!&#x201d; Artemis made a playful grab for the scroll, but he held it away, high above his head so she couldn&#x2019;t nab it.<br> <br>He smiled at Iris in thanks, and then flashed a quick grin of farewell at Antheia. &#x201c;See you!&#x201d;<br> <br>Antheia sighed softly, watching him go. Iris touched her friend&#x2019;s arm, lending support. Truth was, Iris had once like-liked Apollo too. At first he&#x2019;d seemed the perfect fit for her. He was into poetry and she was good with rhyme and colorful writing. He was interested in weather, especially the sun; and you needed sunlight to make a rainbow. For a while Iris had thought they were destined for each other.<br> <br>But then, Antheia had suddenly announced to Iris that she liked Apollo. It hadn&#x2019;t been easy, but Iris had backed off without even telling Antheia about her crush on him.<br> <br>She looked over at Pheme, who had begun quizzing Artemis about the squad&#x2019;s new cheers. It was really lucky that she hadn&#x2019;t guessed about Iris&#x2019;s and Antheia&#x2019;s crushes on Apollo. Lucky also that she hadn&#x2019;t guessed when Iris had gotten her very first crush back in sixth grade.

The equally popular sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</em>, was published in 1872.</p> <p> The <b>Alice</b> books are but one example of his wide ranging authorship.<em> The Hunting of the Snark,</em> a classic nonsense epic (1876) and <em>Euclid and His Modern Rivals,</em> a rare example of humorous work concerning mathematics, still entice and intrigue today's students. <em>Sylvie and Bruno, </em>published toward the end of his life contains startling ideas including an 1889 description of weightlessness.</p> <p> The humor, sparkling wit and genius of this Victorian Englishman have lasted for more than a century. His books are among the most quoted works in the English language, and his influence (with that of his illustrator, Sir John Tenniel) can be seen everywhere, from the world of advertising to that of atomic physics.</p></p><h2>Core Connections Course 3 Volume 2</h2><p>Core connections</p><p></p><h2>Shopping for Buddhas</h2><p>There was a need for non-attachment, to be sure; but also a prerequisite of knife-like resolve. Here in this exotic land, we were compelled to raise the art of shopping to an experience that was, on the other hand, tinged with desperation, like shopping at Macy's during a one-day-only White Sale.<br><br><i>Shopping for Buddhas</i> is Jeff Greenwald's story of his obsessive search for the perfect Buddha statue. In the backstreets of Kathmandu, he discovers more than he bargained for...and his souvenir-hunting turns into an ironic metaphor for the clash between spiritual riches and material greed.

Jeff's most recent book, <i>Snake Lake</i>, is set during Nepal's 1990 Democracy revolution. He lives in Oakland, CA.<br>Waist-high snow, a flying lama and the first escalator in Kathmandu are among the many attractions Greenwald experienced during his stays in Nepal. His often flip tone belies a serious purpose, and his account of shopping for just the right statue of Buddha illuminates various aspects of Nepalese culture. He discusses some of the gods and beliefs of Hinduism and proposes his own list of possible bodhisattvas, whom he describes as people who "recognize . . . their peculiar function" in life (including Mother Teresa and John Lennon). He learns of the Nepalese concept of perfect art, seeks the advice of a guru who wears Ray-Bans and faces the maneuverings of shopkeepers who cater to foreign buyers. Nor does Greenwald overlook the darker side of this country, now undergoing political upheavals. Nepal has been the site of documented human rights abuses, its royal family exploits the country's resources and may be central to promoting drug trafficking there, foreign aid to this impoverished country is distributed among a small number of people, and valuable works of art from temples are being smuggled out of the country.

(Biography).</p><p>Every year a Billy Graham crusade comes to a stadium or a television station near you, the message unchangingly passionate, though the messenger is grayer than he once was. The Reverend Billy Graham is more than just another television evangelist; he is as much a part of this country's collective consciousness as F.D.R. or the Vietnam War. Whether you subscribe to Graham's brand of ecumenical evangelism or not, <i>Just As I Am</i> reveals the man behind the crusade to be forthright, deeply religious, and driven to spread the Word at all costs, even his relationships with his family. Graham is characteristically honest about his failings as a husband and father, admitting that he didn't recognize his own children at a family gathering. <p> In <i>Just As I Am</i> Graham discusses the beginnings of his career, his struggle to subsume intellect to faith, and, of course, the many famous--and infamous--people he has met over the years, everyone from the Shah of Iran to the Queen Mother to mobster Mickey Cohen. Graham's ministry has extended his influence to many quarters of the world, a fact that should make his autobiography interesting reading for believers and non-believers alike.</p>The number-one CBA, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and USA Today best-seller . . . finally in paperback. In Just As I Am, one of the world&#39;s most beloved and respected leaders tells his inspiring life story in a momentous work of faith and insight. Billy Graham is truly the world&#39;s pastor--the man who has preached to more people than any human being who has ever lived (TIME). His message of faith and fortitude has remained singular and strong. Even more notable is that, unlike many of his counterparts, Graham has maintained a noble reputation of integrity with no trace of scandal. Now, at 78, Graham looks back on an incredible lifetime of personal relationships (including every U.S. president since Eisenhower), whirlwind activity, and influence. In a warm, unassuming voice, he shares the stories of his beginnings in the church, the overwhelming success he has achieved as an evangelist, and the tolls this success took on his family. In Just As I Am, Billy Graham shares how he came from ordinary beginnings to have an extraordinary life of prestige and influence--all derived from his unshakable faith in Christ.</p><h2>From Head to Toe</h2><p><p>What does an elephant do? It stomps its foot. Can you? From the creator of such beloved classics as <em>The Grouchy Ladybug</em> and <em>The Mixed-Up Chameleon</em> comes this interactive story that invites kids to imitate animal movements. Watching giraffes bend their necks or monkeys wave their arms is fun, but nothing could be better than joining in. From their heads down to their toes, kids will be wriggling, jiggling, and giggling as they try to keep up with these animals!Alligators wiggle, elephants stop, gorillas thump, and giraffes bend. Can you do it? ' I can do it!' is the confidence-building message of this fun-filled interactive picture book. A variety of familiar animals invite young children to copy their antics, and as they play, they will learn such important skills as careful listening, focusing attention, and following instructions. Just as alphabet books introduce the very young child to letters and simple words, From Head to Toe introduces the basic body parts and simple body movements. And in the same way that children progress from understanding simple words to reading and writing sentences and stories, so they will progress from simple body movements to dancing, gymnastics, and other sports and activities, with confidence and pleasure.</p><p>Eric Carle's colorful collages have delighted children for more than a generation. Each book provides hours of fun while encouraging them to stretch their imaginations. His matchless words and illustrations now send out a new challenge:</p><p>Are you ready?<br>Here we go!<br>Move yourself<br>From Head to Toe.</p></p><p><p>Eric Carle is the creator of more than seventy picture books for young readers. </p><p>Eric Carle was born in New York, USA. However, when he was just six, he moved with his parents to Germany. In 1952, after graduating from the prestigious Akademie der Bildenden K�nste in Stuttgart, he fulfilled his dream of returning to New York.</p><p>Eric Carle has received many distinguished awards and honours for his work, including, in 2003, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for his lifetime contribution to children's literature and illustration. </p><p>In 2002, fifty years after Carle's return to the United States, The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art was opened in Amherst, Massachusetts.

Can you do it?'' asks the animal of the child. ``I can do it!'' is the invariable reply. If readers participate in the gestures shown on every page, they'll get something of a work-out, for the analogies are good: foot-stomping elephants, clapping seals, and shoulder-hunching buffalo are enticingly imitatable. The book's large size and bold, brightly colored animals make it ideal for story hours. Unusual for Carle--and highlighted by the emphasis on action--is the stiffness of the collages: Neither children nor animals convey a sense of motion, but appear locked into place. Linda Lowery's Twist With a Burger, Jitter With a Bug (1995) inspires similar participation, but is a more rhythmic and vivacious book.

This is a book that teaches readers not just how to read faster, but also techniques that can help them retain what they have read. Speed reading techniques are not just about counting how many words an individual can read in a minute. To actually read something states that it is important that the person understands what is being read. How To Read Better And Faster by Norman Lewis is based on the premise that one s reading speed is linked to concentration and retention. One cannot happen without the other. So, if a person s reading speed increases, a significant increase in his concentration and powers of retention should also be noted. The book shows readers some practical ways in which they can increase their reading speed. It contains exercises that can be practised to achieve an increase in one s reading speed. It defines goals and shows the reader different ways in which he can achieve those goals. This approach makes it easy for the reader to apply the skills taught in the book and check the results. Increasing one s reading speed can be helpful in many situations - for students who are going through a lot of study material to prepare for their exams, for business executives who have to go through a lot of notes and reports in a day, for researchers who have to go through piles of reference material, and the list goes on. The book even teaches readers how to look at a page and take in the main points, and how to build their reading vocabulary. Regardless of whether the reader just wants to scan a newspaper faster, finish a novel in a few hours, or go through huge amounts of reference material faster, this book is always useful.</p><p>Norman Lewis was a noted grammarian and author, and considered an expert on the English language. He has also written several bestselling books including, 30 Days To A More Powerful Vocabulary, Rapid Vocabulary Builder, Correct Spelling Made Easy, Better English, and Word Power Made Easy. Born on 30th December, 1912, in New York, he published his first article at the age of eleven, and graduated with a Master s Degree in English from Columbia University. Having begun a teaching career at City College of New York, and New York University, he taught English for more than three decades, at Rio Hondo College in California, and passed away at the age of 93, in 2006.An average Indian reader reading English script will have a wpm of 220-280. This book will definitely take your wpm count beyond 350. The book is a methodical home trainer, with regular practice on lit pieces alongside the book will give you a 80-95% comprehension and a high reading speed in 2-3 months. I would recommend it a must to anyone who are struggling to increase their RC and its so much easy after you pick up that speed and comprehension. Now I read newspapers with so much easy and you feel good about having made that investment in the book, which has increased your speed and comprehension. --Santosh Angada.. on 01 Feb 2012<br><br>You will never have encountered a book so effective that u get overwhelmed by its positives so much that u don't have time time to find flaws in it. For anyone looking to not just increase reading speed but make himself an efficient reader this book is a boon....Go four it do not think!! --Abhishek Jaiswal on 07 May 2012<br><br>This book is like a workbook, wherein you get tips and techniques to improve your reading speed followed by exercises to practice these techniques. You also get to keep measuring your reading speed regularly, so you can definitely see for yourself whether these techniques are effective or not. If you go through this book diligently, am sure your reading speed would improve a lot in due course of time. But don't expect that without practicing diligently you will suddenly improve your reading speed just by studying about the techniques-that would be like thinking that you can swim just by reading about swimming! --Aravind on 20 Jul 2014</p><h2>Cat of Many Tails</h2><p>The cat had 9 kills.

But the strangler struck elsewhere.</p><p></p><h2>Red Letters: Fresh Reflections on the Words of Jesus</h2><p>Many Christians hunger for a consistent devotional life but also want their time with God to be one of study in which they further their knowledge and understanding of God&#39;s Word. Now they can have both in one engaging book. Written by a popular father-son team, Red Letters is a book of Bible study devotionals based on some of the most memorable words of Jesus, such as &#34;follow me&#34;, &#34;not by bread alone,&#34; and the Lord&#39;s Prayer. With more than fifty-two devotionals, including a special section for Holy Week, readers can choose to read Red Letters in daily or weekly formats. Each devotional also has special sections and sidebars, like Greek Peek, Quotes to Note, and Dare to Compare, that give readers further nuggets of knowledge.</p><p>Jesus had quite a way with words. A man on a journey, a shepherd with his flock, a woman sweeping a floor-each of these characters took on new meaning as Jesus spoke of them. Whether he was sharing colorful stories, asking pointed questions, or serving up short sayings rich with insight and understanding, people from all over would flock to his side to hear him speak. Even today people find encouragement, hope, and faith in Jesus&#39; enduring, memorable words. Red Letters is an inventive twist on studying the Bible; it&#39;s a devotional with a difference. With more than 50 sections covering nearly 150 of Jesus&#39; sayings, the authors make the narratives and characters come alive. Questions, ideas for meaningful reflection, and dozens of interactive sidebars will help you hear these words again and in a whole new way. Whether you read this book daily, two or three times a week, or even once a week with a small group, you&#39;re sure to gain a new appreciation, a new friend, and perhaps a new Lord. William J.

Deep in the recesses of the Vatican, Nick Tosches unearths a first-century memoir by Gaius Fulvius Falconius, foremost speechwriter for Emperor Tiberius. The codex is profound, proof of the existence of a Messiah who was anything but the one we've known -- a shabby and licentious thief. <br><br>After encountering him in the streets of Judea, Gaius becomes spin doctor to Jesus, and the pair schemes to accrue untold riches by convincing the masses that Jesus is the Son of God. As their marriage of truth and lies is consummated, friendship and wary respect develop between these two grifters.<br><br>Outrageous and disturbing, <i>Under Tiberius</i> is as black as the ravishing night, shot through with fierce and brilliant light.</p><p><b>Nick Tosches</b> is from Newark, New Jersey.

How did it happen? What created the twin emotions of praise and anger, of gratitude and fear? What forces pushed me, compelled me, or led me to play my particular role in the struggle to make the Christian church respond to the issues of our century and indeed to open new dimensions of spirituality to the citizens of this century? That is the story I seek to tell."</blockquote><p></p><p>John Shelby Spong has spent a lifetime struggling to discover and create a more just, loving, and authentic Christian faith. Throughout his career as an Episcopal priest and bishop, he has inspired praise and gratitude among the marginalized Christians whose causes he has championed, as well as hostile resistance from traditional and conservative Christians whom he has so boldly challenged. <em>Here I Stand </em>reveals the private side of this very public figure, as Bishop Spong tells the story of the people and events that shaped his thoroughly contemporary yet deeply biblical theology and his commitment to liberal Christian values.</p><p>Early in his life, Spong witnessed injustices that were instrumental in awakening his moral consciousness. Growing up in the American south of the 1930s, Spong spent his childhood in an environment of racism, fundamentalism, sexism, and homophobia. The church of his time was no exception; its exclusionary attitudes and practices struck the young Southerner as contradictory to the Christianity he encountered in the Bible and heard preached from the pulpit and taught in Sunday school.</p><p>Rather than becoming disillusioned with the church and dropping out, Spong has devoted himself to reforming it, working to integrate women, blacks, gays, lesbians, and other marginalized Christians fully into the faith community better known for rejecting or marginalizing them. In the process, he has challenged the views of leaders such as Jerry Falwell, John Cardinal 0' Connor, and his own Episcopal hierarchy. He has been honored by many as a hero, while enduring harsh reactions from fundamentalists and those wedded to the status quo. Through it all, Bishop Spong has remained committed to his role as a shepherd to every member of the Christian flock. His courageous efforts have made him an inspirational symbol of a Christian church truly worthy of Jesus and the standard bearer for those who strive to be both contemporary, thinking persons and faithful, enlightened Christians.</p></p><p><i>Here I Stand</i> is the autobiography of John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal bishop who is a lightning rod for controversy. Spong has for decades been working to popularize an inclusive version of Christianity that avoids racism, sexism, and homophobia; as a result, he has engaged leading conservatives (such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson) in very public conflicts. <i>Here I Stand</i>, predictably, gives a blow-by-blow of Spong's high-profile battles. More surprisingly, Spong also shares some very intimate details about his life that help to explain the sources of his theology. His southern childhood is related in a manner that is every bit as painful and comic as a Flannery O'Connor story. And the story of his first marriage, to a woman whose mental illness persisted for 15 years, is handled with sensitivity and grace. Despite his occasional rhetorical excesses, Spong's book is clearly written in love--with God, with the Church, and with the world. "I walk inside the wonder of this God in every experience of life," he writes at the book's end. We are fortunate that Spong's autobiography so expertly conveys this wonder.<p>John Shelby Spong, the Episcopal Bishop of Newark before his retirement in 2000, has been a visiting lecturer at Harvard and at more than 500 other universities all over the world.

Brinton, alerted by his bank manager, has been trying to find the cause of a rash of depressing events among the area's senior citizens--a suicide here; a case of starvation there; and the unexplained depletion of funds in never ample accounts. Miss Seeton, meanwhile, has been fending off the attempts of London conceptual artist Antony Scarlett, egged on by his publicity hungry gallery owner, to buy her house, which he wants to fill with chocolate and then demolish. Scarlett's long black cloak and theatrical presence have given rise to some weird speculation in the village, reinforced by the arrival of Tina Holloway, Scarlett's onetime overweight model and lover, dismissed when she thinned down, now seeking a reconciliation but encouraged by Miss Seeton to concentrate instead on her own burgeoning talent. The killing of Tina, in her room at the local inn, poses another puzzle for Superintendent Brinton, and its solution lies, as usual, with Miss Seeton. The story's last-minute murder defies belief, with its full- of-holes motive, but, still, there's fun to be had with a full cast of endearingly zany villagers, the loony London art scene, and the ever gently intuitive Miss Seeton. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Nefarious doings take a backseat to the flamboyant shenanigans of a contemporary artist in Miss Seeton's latest brush with crime (after Sold to Miss Seeton). A number of elderly pensioners in Plummergen are dying, apparently by accident or suicide, after having suddenly depleted their savings. Miss Seeton has her hands full, however, with Antony Scarlett, a sculptor determined to use Miss Seeton's Plummergen cottage as the mold for his latest project, which involves filling the house with chocolate. Dressed in his signature black velvet cloak lined with red satin, Scarlett descends upon Miss Seeton's home. On his trail is the redheaded beauty and rejected model Tina Holloway, who has grown to despise chocolate but desperately wants Scarlett back. Demonstrating their own distinctive creative talents, the village women observe Scarlett coming and going and conclude he is a vampire in search of virginal sustenance. Miss Seeton takes Holloway in hand, and soon the young model finds her own artistic talent, true love and the final clue necessary to solve the series of deaths known to police as the Pauper Pensioner Puzzle. As usual, the puzzle isn't much, but watching the avant-garde Scarlett among the rustics adds a sort of dotty English sitcom slapstick to this lighthearted, lightweight series. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Complete Violin Sonatas and Trio Sonatas (Dover Chamber Music Scores)</h2><p><p>Among the chief glories of Baroque music are the violin and trio sonatas of Arcangelo Corelli (1653&#x2013;1713), elegant compositions of supreme lyric expressiveness. <i>Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians</i> has this to say about Corelli's music: "All his works are characterized by conciseness and lucidity of thought and form, and by a dignified, almost aristocratic bearing.

Yet in hospitals and doctors' offices across the country, errors are made every single day - avoidable, simple mistakes that often cost lives. Inspired by two medical mistakes that not only ended in unnecessary deaths but hit close to home, Dr. Peter Pronovost made it his personal mission to improve patient safety and make preventable deaths a thing of the past, one hospital at a time. <br><br> Dr. Pronovost began with simple improvements to a common procedure in the ER and ICU units at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Creating an easy five-step checklist based on the most up-to-date research for his fellow doctors and nurses to follow, he hoped that streamlining the procedure itself could slow the rate of infections patients often died from. <br><br> But what Dr. Pronovost discovered was that doctors and nurses needed more than a checklist: the day-to-day environment needed to be more patient-driven and staff needed to see scientific results in order to know their efforts were a success. After those changes took effect, the units Dr. Pronovost worked with decreased their rate of infection by 70%. <br><br> Today, all fifty states are implementing Dr. Pronovost's programs, which have the potential to save more lives than any other medical innovation in the past twenty-five years. But his ideas are just the beginning of the changes being made by doctors and nurses across the country making huge leaps to improve patient care. In <i>Safe Patients, Smart Hospitals</i>, Dr. Pronovost shares his own experience, anecdotal stories from his colleagues at Johns Hopkins and other hospitals that have made his approach their own, alongside comprehensive research-showing readers how small changes make a huge difference in patient care. <br><br> Inspiring and thought provoking, this compelling book shows how one person with a cause really can make a huge difference in our lives.</p><p>PETER PRONOVOST, Ph.D, M.D., is a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and serves as medical director for the Johns Hopkins Center for Innovation in Quality Patient Care.<br>ERIC VOHR was formerly the assistant director of media relations at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and he teaches technical writing at Johns Hopkins University.Excerpted from SAFE PATIENTS, SMART HOSPITALS: How One Doctor&#x2019;s Checklist Can Help Us Change Health Card From the Inside Out by Peter Pronovost, M.D., Ph. D, and Eric Vohr, publishing February 18th, 2010. <b><p>Chapter 3</p></b><p>We use checklists to standardize and ensure quality, consistency and safety every day of our lives. Even something as ubiquitous as our morning cup of coffee comes with its own checklist. I found this one on the Starbucks Website:</p><ul><li>Use the right proportions of coffee and water -- 2 tablespoons of coffee for 6 ounces water</li><li>Match the correct grind to the coffee making process -- fine for espresso, medium for drip, coarse for a French press.</li><li>Use good water -- coffee is 98 percent water, so if the water tastes good, the coffee will taste good.</li><li>Make sure the coffee is fresh -- like all natural elements, coffee deteriorates when exposed to light, air and moisture.</li></ul><p>As simple as this sounds, coffee is complex -- nowhere near as complex as the human body, but nonetheless complex. One could easily write a 300-page book on how to best transform this scrubby little plant into a delicious, warm, eye-opening beverage. Roast, altitude, soil, sunlight and rainfall, all have effect on the flavor. However, according to Starbucks, when I wake up and prepare my morning fix all I have to worry about are the &#x201c;four fundamentals,&#x201d; proportion, grind, water and freshness -- a checklist, if you will.</p><p>Successful companies, like Starbucks, have been using checklists for years to ensure quality. Important processes are standardized and consistently performed whether in Baltimore or Beijing. Yet standardization is sorely lacking in health care. </p><p>Look at a something as obvious as hand washing. It&#x2019;s been known in medicine for more than a century that this simple procedure can reduce infections and save lives. Yet doctors do not wash their hands consistently when visiting a patient and there is no standardized procedure in place to ensure they do. They know they are supposed to, but on average they do it 30 percent of the time. Perhaps more alarming, most hospitals do not monitor rates of hand washing and there&#x2019;s no accountability for this performance. And while people don&#x2019;t usually die from bad coffee, many patients have likely died from bacteria on a physician&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>Why isn&#x2019;t hand washing standardized in hospitals &#x2013; along with thousands of other procedures that are known to save lives? It would be easy to blame doctors, but the bulk of the problem does not lie there. Most physicians care deeply about their work and want nothing but the safest care for their patients. It&#x2019;s the culture of medicine and the systems within which doctors practice that are at fault. Physicians, including myself, are trained to believe that we don&#x2019;t need standardization because we don&#x2019;t make mistakes; we are told that our brains have endless storage capacity and that we have perfect recall of all the thousands of hours of information we&#x2019;ve learned from medical school and years of practice. Yet we do not. The fact is, just like all other humans, we forget. We are fallible. We do not see systems and we are not trained to improve them.</p><p>Furthermore, doctors are also trained to believe that we don&#x2019;t always have to follow the rules or ask for anyone&#x2019;s help. We are the smartest people in the world and can figure out any problem on our own. When I was in medical school, I remember specifically being told, &#x201c;Guidelines are for simple physicians not Hopkins physicians. At Hopkins we know the evidence, we are expert clinicians; we know the nuances of our patients so we do not need guidelines.&#x201d; I have since realized how dangerous it is to use that statement to train physicians. </p><p>It&#x2019;s true every patient is unique and clear guidelines are often absent or incomplete, making it necessary for doctors to rely on professional judgment to make personal, often independent, decisions about care. When evidence is immature or lacking, our intuition or reasoning is often the best evidence we have. However, we also need to recognize that standardization offers tremendous benefits, especially when evidence is robust. As medical science matures, we must progress from providing care primarily based on intuition, to a place where this independent approach is properly balanced with care based on collective wisdom and proven scientific evidence. </p><p>Yet as science continues to propel us into the future at an alarming rate, the culture of medicine dwells solemnly in the past. We do not train clinicians about the value of standardization, we do not train physicians to share knowledge or to improve bad systems that harm patients, we do not train physicians to work as a team organized around the patient and for the most part we do not hold them accountable for their performance or patient outcomes.</p></p><h2>Dream: The Words and Inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Me-we)</h2><p>DREAM: The Words and Inspiration of Martin Luther King, Jr. is part of the new Me We book series from Blue Mountain Arts�.

But how about Alex Rodriguez, Jeter&#39;s teammate, former American League MVP, and probable future Hall of Famer? Many would argue he&#39;s even better than Jeter. And what about Jeter&#39;s seemingly unassailable status as one of the greatest Yankees of all time? Such discussions highlight one of the great joys of being a baseball fan: arguing over who&#39;s really great and who falls just short, who doesn&#39;t get the respect he deserves and who gets too much. In other words, who&#39;s overrated and who&#39;s underrated. In The Stark Truth, baseball analyst, writer, and researcher Jayson Stark of ESPN considers the entire history of professional baseball and picks the most overblown and underappreciated players in the history of the game. His results, based on extensive research using both traditional and more modern methods of evaluating baseball players and performance, are provocative, entertaining, and go a long way toward settling many of baseball&#39;s most persistent debates. No book can hope to settle every baseball argument, but The Stark Truth: The Most Overrated and Underrated Players in Baseball History takes one of baseball&#39;s most enduring debates and provides some compelling and stunning clarity.</p><p>"When I first knew Jayson Stark, he was often mistaken for Bernie Carbo, the erstwhile Red Sox outfielder. In a very short time, Jayson was himself unmistakable for his creative, thoughtful, human, humorous, and passionate writing that has made him one of the greatest of all baseball journalists. Everything he has done has been thoroughly researched and thought out, which is what makes his study of the most underrated and overrated players so fascinating. You know one thing as you open the book--that Stark will touch on things you never even thought about." --Peter Gammons, Hall of Fame baseball writer and ESPN baseball analyst <p>"Jayson Stark has always, in my opinion, been the most underrated baseball writer since man started writing about the game. Of course, I may have been influenced a little by the fact that I'm in his book. Nevertheless, if this book doesn't end up in Oprah's Book Club, then Oprah's list is overrated."--Andy Van Slyke, underrated centerfielder, underrated back-jacket blurb writer, and current Tigers first-base coach </p><p>"There is no one with more passion for baseball than Jayson Stark... Once you've read this book, you'll know why..." --Mike Greenberg, undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, and co-host of ESPN's Mike and Mike in the Morning</p>It's one of the oldest pastimes known to man, dating as far back as the invention of the wheel (somewhat overrated) and the discovery of fire (vastly underrated). But not until thousands of years later, with the arrival of baseball, did the overrated-underrated debate really fulfill its potential. <p>This great sport was virtually made for the (overrated-underrated) debate, and the chances of any living soul having not engaged in it at one time or another are small. Whether you are a hardcore fan or a casual observer, you almost certainly have been lured into a war of wits on the merits, or lack thereof, of a particular ballplayer, team, or record-setting achievement. Sports-radio-talk-show hosts are well-known instigators of these kinds of debates, as are baseball columnists, friends, ex-friends, or the complete stranger sitting three seats down at the local watering hole. </p><p>It really doesn't matter if you went to the five-tool school of baseball verbiage or if you know just enough about the team in your zip code to survive the occasional water-cooler gossip; the O-U debate is so subjective that any argument could last for hours, regardless of the presence of statistical facts or hardball knowledge in the discussion. That was the case, of course, until Jayson Stark took it upon himself to end the debate once and for all in The Stark Truth--or, more likely, energize it for years to come. Stark, a baseball columnist and television analyst for the better part of the last three decades, attempts to identify the most overrated and underrated players of all time at each position. He'll be the first to admit that his selections will invite skepticism and even controversy, which is the very essence of the O-U debate. In Stark's findings, based on years of research and mounds of statistics (which, he says, can be somewhat overrated), you will see more Hall of Fame players than also-rans on both sides of the fence. One can be considered the best player of his time and still be overrated--or underrated--which makes The Stark Truth a fascinating journey into the greatest debate about the greatest game.</p></p><h2>Liberty Against the Law: Some Seventeenth-Century Controversies</h2><p>In the plays and popular folklore of the 17th and 18th centuries are many expressions of liberty against the law: there are the colorful beggars of "The Jovial Crew" who are no worse than the eminent politicians; the ballads of Robin Hood personify the opposition between the freedom of the outlaw in the woods and the status constraints on the society man. Christopher Hill considers how the peasantry was effected by enclosures, the loss of many traditional rights, and draconian punishments for minor transgressions. These expressions of contempt for the law challenge the equation of law with property and begin to pose the question, "Freedom for Whom?" Wrote Keith Thomas in <i>The Guardian</i>, "Hill must have read more of the literature written in and about 17-century England than anyone who has ever lived. He misses nothing."</p><p>Christopher Hill, the peerless people&#39;s historian of the 17th century, has written a book that challenges the common history of liberty and the birth of liberal politics. While historians from Lord Acton to J. H. Hexter have written histories in which property-holding men figure as the champions of liberal freedom, Professor Hill deftly illustrates the manner in which enclosure laws and claims to property were used to deny the traditional rights of the common folk of 17th-century England. Drawing evidence from popular ballads, plays, and his extensive knowledge of the period&#39;s literature, Professor Hill demonstrates that the supposed &#34;dawn&#34; of liberal rights and freedoms brought economic dependence, penal punishment, and the loss of freedom for the rural poor and artisan classes who were being swiftly enveloped in a burgeoning commercial society.Christopher Hill was assistant lecturer in Modern History at University College, Cardiff, Fellow and Tutor in Modern History at Balliol, Master of Balliol College, and then for two years a Visiting Professor at the Open University.</p><h2>Hymns of the Sikh Gurus</h2><p>The vision of Guru Nanak, the fifteenth-century founder of the Sikh faith, celebrated the oneness of the Divine that both dwells within and transcends the endless diversity of life.

It is the story of the rebirth of Quoyle, a hulking, inarticulate, misery-ridden widower who flees upstate New York to take up residence in Newfoundland. The island of his forebears, Newfoundland is a dreary rock in the north Atlantic beset by lousy weather. Proulx lovingly recreates this hardscrabble location in her vivid, distinctive prose and populates it with a cast of amusing, richly human characters. Quoyle, a &#34;third-rate newspaperman,&#34; makes a hit with his &#34;Shipping News&#34; column, while his anguish at the loss of his faithless wife is slowly transformed by the strengthening ties that bind him to the place and to his fellow Newfoundlanders.<p> E. Annie Proulx focuses on a Newfoundland fishing town in a tale about a third-rate newspaperman and the women in his life -- his elderly aunt and two young daughters -- who decide to resettle in their ancestral seaside home.

City of splendour. City of terror. City of dreams. Inspired by the haunting, passionate story of the city of lights, this epic novel weaves a gripping tale of four families across the centuries: from the lies that spawn the noble line of de Cygne to the revolutionary Le Sourds who seek their destruction; from the Blanchards whose bourgeois respectability offers scant protection against scandal to the hard-working Gascons and their soaring ambitions. Over hundreds of years, these four families are bound by forbidden loves and marriages of convenience; dogged by vengeance and murderous secrets; torn apart by the irreconcilable differences of birth and faith, and brought together by the tumultuous history of their city. Paris bursts to life in the intrigue, corruption and glory of its people. Beloved author of Sarum, London and New York, Edward Rutherfurd illuminates Paris as only he can: capturing the romance and everyday drama of the men and women who, in two thousand years, transformed a humble trading post on the muddy banks of the Seine into the most celebrated city in the world.</p><p><p><b>Essay by Edward Rutherfurd</b></p> <p>I was eight when I fell in love with Paris. Though my family was British, we had many French cousins, and that year we all went over to Paris to see them.</p> <p>There was the magical drive around floodlit Paris; the river trip, the walk down the Champs-Elysees. The smell of Gauloises cigarettes--now gone--and French coffee, the taste of real French cooking, a far cry from the food I knew. I took pictures from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and gazed in rapture at the Napoleonic army of toy soldiers in Les Invalides. And then there was the sound of my cousins speaking French--charming, sensuous, mysterious.</p> <p>But it was something unexpected that impressed me most.</p> <p>My French cousin Isabelle was driving me and my father's elderly aunt. By mistake, she made an illegal turn. The police pounced. Isabelle apologized. The policeman was stony-faced. Then Isabelle had an inspiration.</p> <p>"You see, Monsieur, I was taking my aunt from England for a drive," she explained.</p> <p>The policeman bent down, looked at the little old lady on the back seat, stood at attention and saluted. "Passez, Madame," he said gallantly.</p> <p>We've all encountered occasional rudeness in France, but throw yourself on a French person's mercy, and their sense of chivalry usually kicks in. That's the special charm of France.</p> <p>I stayed with my cousins often after that. One Parisian family lived just up the street from Proust's childhood home, and only yards from where the Statue of Liberty was constructed. Others had an old house in Fontainebleau, with a veranda straight out of a Manet painting, and family stories that went back to Napoleonic times. Others lived near the Bastille, or in Hemingway's Montparnasse, or in the Latin Quarter--wonderfully convenient when, as a teenager, I needed to sneak into the revolutionary riots in 1968. All these places found their way into my novel.</p> <p>The son of a laborer taught me street-fighting--my background for the Gascon family. I knew an old monarchist priest who still held the French kings sacred; an aristocrat who'd known Chagall, and a virulent Marxist student. I lived with professional families whose shared memories went back to the days of the Belle Epoque and beyond. These were the sources of my characters and stories.</p> <p>And as a young man, I also fell in love in Paris, with an older woman, which left me with memories of Neuilly when the horse chestnuts are in blossom, and of walks in the Parisian dawn, and an old house with parquet floors that creaked, and the smell of fresh croissants and cafe au lait in the morning.</p> <p>But if Marcel Proust found the past brought vividly back to life by the taste of a madeleine, I too have a taste and smell to share; of eating frogs legs at the age of eight, and being sick afterwards . . . I still can't bear the smell. I'll stick to the croissants and cafe au lait!</p>Edward Rutherfurd was born in England, in the cathedral city of Salisbury. Educated locally, and at the universities of Cambridge, and Stanford, California, he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing. After numerous attempts to write books and plays, he finally abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983, and returned to his childhood home to write SARUM, a historical novel with a ten-thousand year story, set in the area around the ancient monument of Stonehenge, and Salisbury. Four years later, when Sarum was published, it became an instant international bestseller, remaining 23 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Since then he has written five more bestsellers: RUSSKA, a novel of Russia; LONDON; THE FOREST, set in England&#39;s New Forest which lies close by Sarum, and two novels which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before Saint Patrick to the twentieth century. In 2009 NEW YORK was published, and Edward is hard at work on another big novel at present.

(<i>Daily Telegraph</i>)</p><h2>Measures for Clinical Practice: A Sourcebook: Volume 1: Couples, Families, and Children, Third Edition</h2><p>Today, as practitioners in all areas of the human services are increasingly held accountable for monitoring and evaluating their practices in an objective and efficient manner, a sound familiarity with objective measurement is more essential than ever before. In addition, practitioners must also be concerned with satisfying a dizzying array of state, agency, health maintenance organization, and insurance company guidelines. <p> For more than twelve years, through two highly acclaimed editions and now in an updated and expanded third edition, Kevin Corcoran and Joel Fischer's standard reference, <i>Measures for Clinical Practice,</i> has enabled professionals to gather this vital information easily and effectively. In <i>Measures for Clinical Practice, Volume 1: Couples, Families, and Children, <i>and</i> Volume 2: Adults,</i> Corcoran and Fischer provide an extensive collection of more than 400"rapid assessment instruments" (RAIs), including many questionnaires and scales, which assess virtually any problem commonly encountered in clinical practice. Corcoran and Fischer have revised this edition to reflect new research and contemporary clinical practices. They include new scales and materials in areas such as assessment in culturally diverse populations and measurement in managed care systems, as well as the best instruments updated from the previous editions. </p><p> Brief and easy to administer, these "best practice measures" will be useful for all types of therapeutic and theoretical orientations. All instruments are actually reprinted in the book, and are carefully introduced and evaluated to aid in their selection. Corcoran and Fischer explain the principles of measurement and how to apply them in practice. They explore the range of assessment techniques available, including behavioral observations, rating scales, and client logs, as well as unobtrusive, electromechanical, and standardized measures. And after examining the advantages and disadvantages of rapid assessment instruments, they show practitioners how to effectively select and administer these measures as part of the treatment process. </p><p> More comprehensive than ever, this edition of <i>Measures for Clinical Practice</i> is essential to every practitioner and student of social work, psychology, psychiatry, nursing, counseling, and the rehabilitative therapies.</p></p><p><b>Kevin Corcoran, Ph.D., J.D.,</b> is a professor in the Graduate School of Social Work at Portland State University.<b>Foreword</b> <p> Historians of behavioral science reviewing progress in the provision of human services at some point in the future will have to confront a curious issue. They will note that the twentieth century witnessed the development of a science of human behavior. They will also note that from mid-century on, clinicians treating behavioral and emotional disorders began relying more heavily on the systematic application of theories and facts emanating from this science to emotional and behavioral problems. They will make observations on various false starts in the development of our therapeutic techniques, and offer reasons for the initial acceptance of these "false starts" in which clinicians or practitioners would apply exactly the same intervention or style of intervention to every problem that came before them. But in the last analysis historians will applaud the slow but systematic development of ever more powerful specific procedures and techniques devised to deal successfully with the variety of specific emotional and behavioral problems. This will be one of the success stories of the twentieth century. </p><p> Historians will also note a curious paradox which they will be hard pressed to explain. They will write that well into the 1990s few practitioners or clinicians evaluated the effects of their new treatments in any systematic way. Rather, whatever the behavioral or emotional problem, they would simply ask clients from time to time how they were feeling or how they were doing. Sometimes this would be followed by reports in an official chart or record duly noting clients' replies. If families or married couples were involved, a report from only one member of the interpersonal system would often suffice. Occasionally, these attempts at "evaluation" would reach peaks of quantifiable objectivity by presenting the questions in somewhat different ways such as "how are you feeling or doing compared to a year ago when you first came to see me?" </p><p> Historians will point out wryly that this practice would be analogous to physicians periodically asking patients with blood infections or fractures "how are you feeling" without bothering to analyze blood samples or take X rays. "How could this have been?" they will ask. In searching for answers they will examine records of clinical practice in the late twentieth century and find that the most usual response from clinicians was that they were simply too busy to evaluate what they were doing. But the real reason, astute historians will note, is that they never learned how. </p><p> Our government regulatory agencies, and other institutions, have anticipated these turn-of-the-century historians with the implementation of procedures requiring practitioners to evaluate what they do. This practice, most often subsumed under the rubric of "accountability," will very soon have a broad and deep hold on the practice of countless human service providers. But more important than the rise of new regulations will be the full realization on the part of all practitioners of the ultimate logic and wisdom of evaluating what they do. In response to this need, a number of books have appeared of late dealing with methods to help practitioners evaluate what they do. Some books even suggest that this will enable clinicians to make direct contributions to our science. Using strategies of repeated measurement of emotional and behavioral problems combined with sophisticated case study procedures and single case experimental designs, the teaching of these methods is increasing rapidly in our graduate and professional schools. But at the heart of this process is measurement, and the <i>sine qua non</i> of successful measurement is the availability of realistic and practical measures of change. Only through wide dissemination of realistic, practical, and accurate measures of change will practitioners be able to fulfill the requirements of accountability as well as their own growing sense of personal obligation to their clients to evaluate their intervention. Up until now this has been our weakness, not because satisfactory measures did not exist, but because so many widely scattered measurement tools existed that it was impossible for any one practitioner to keep track of these developments, let alone make a wise choice of which measures might be useful. </p><p> Corcoran and Fischer have accomplished this task and the result is this excellent book, now in its 3rd edition, that not only describes the essentials of measurement but also presents the most up-to-date and satisfactory measures of change for almost any problem a practitioner might encounter. Concentrating on what they call rapid assessment instruments (RAIs), they present a series of brief questionnaires most of which fulfill the criterion of being under 50 items, thereby requiring no more than several minutes to fill out. By cross-referencing these RAIs by problem areas, no practitioner need take more than a few minutes to choose the proper questionnaire for any problem or combination of problems with which he or she might be confronted. With its well-written and easy-to-read chapters on what makes a brief questionnaire measure satisfactory or unsatisfactory, this book should be on the shelf of every practitioner working in a human service setting. Through the use of this book practitioners will not only be able to meet growing demands for accountability, but also satisfy their own desires for objective, quantifiable indications of progress in a manner that can be accomplished in no more than several minutes. As this activity becomes an integral part of the delivery of human services, the value of this book will increase. </p><p> David H.

Since it had left Earth over three years ago, it had been alone, traveling through the depths of space to the seventh planet, Uranus, then settling into a wide elliptical orbit. For the past six months, ISMB 6 had faithfully done its job, taking readings of the surface of the planet, using its cameras and sensors and equipment to explore the outer reaches of the solar system.<br><br>ISMB 6 was a hardworking little craft, although from the outside it seemed like little more than a piece of space junk in an area devoid of anything else man-made. A silver craft, the diameter of a small bedroom, its surface was cluttered with a myriad of dishes, antennas, and measuring devices, making it look like a spider. On the side of the craft, in one of the only small, open areas of the main body, were the letters ISMB followed by the number 6. Under the letters were a dozen tiny stencils of flags, indicating the countries that had helped in the joint project.<br><br>Out here, everything familiar seemed remote. Even the sun was nothing more than a distant hole of light in the massive field of stars, not even strong enough to cast real shadows, or supply any real warmth.<br><br>Not that ISMB 6 cared. It was one of seven buoys designed by American and Japanese engineers, and sent outward by a consortium of twelve countries, all believing that the heavens needed to be monitored as the seas were once monitored. The early scientists saw the ISMB system as a twofold project: the buoys would act as ways to gather information in deep space, and they would also serve as the markers of Earth's boundaries.<br><br>Surprisingly, the nations making up the consortium did not want to consider the boundary issue. To them, having boundaries meant defending them, sending weapons into space, perhaps even developing a fleet.<br><br>Such things are not necessary, the politicians said, unless there is a perceived threat. And of course, there was no threat and no hint of one ever appearing. The politicians believed we were alone. The scientists weren't sure.<br><br>So the consortium took its funding and built the seven buoys, launching them over a three-year period. Three buoys orbited the three largest planets in the solar system: Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. Two buoys were stationed over the sun's poles, holding positions above and below the plane of the solar system at a distance from the sun about the same as Mars. The seventh was completing the last year of its flight to catch and orbit Pluto.<br><br>All seven sent a constant stream of data Earthward, powered by batteries designed to last thirty years, even without solar reenergizing. The data was received at stations all over Earth and relayed to a classroom-sized area three floors under a complex outside of Sydney, Australia. The complex housed, at times, upwards of a hundred scientists from around the world, studying on-site the information being sent back from the buoys.<br><br>At the complex, ISMB 6 was the only buoy that hadn't been assigned a nickname. The nicknames suggested by the English-speaking scientists were too crude to use, even accidentally, at press conferences, and besides, the jokes did not translate well into the complex's other approved languages. As a result, the scientists who tried to create a shred of personality in their tools imagined ISMB 6 as a serious, unimaginative little worker, who could be relied upon at all times.<br><br>ISMB 6 wasn't aware of any of this. ISMB 6 really wasn't aware of anything. It simply went about its job, orbiting Uranus, sending telemetry back to Earth. It's entire mission was routine, as routine as a pioneering mission could be until ISMB 6's third orbit of the day, a day artificially measured in Earth time.<br><br>As ISMB 6 rose slightly above and beyond the dark, cold surface of Uranus, a blackness seemed to loom near the little craft, almost as if an invisible cloud of soot was filling space.<br><br>Then, with a weak, reflected flash of light from the darkness, all data stopped flowing toward Earth.<br><br>All instruments shut down.<br><br>ISMB 6, the faithful, hardworking little buoy, was dead.<br>August 16, 2017: 4:56 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time <br> 240 Days Until Arrival<br><br>Orange and yellow bands of light cut through the morning mist as the sun peeked above the Coast Mountain Range. The morning air had a thick dampness that felt more appropriate to winter than to August, yet by noon the chill would be gone and the temperature would hit eighty.<br><br>Dr. Edwin Bradshaw ducked out of his tent and pulled his jacket tight around his shoulders, shivering slightly in the cool morning air. A mile to the west the Pacific Ocean rumbled as the surf hit the beach. He couldn't see the water--the tall pine trees that surrounded him prevented that--but he could hear the ocean. Its sound was constant, sometimes a low murmur and sometimes an angry explosive pounding. And sometimes this rumble.<br><br>He found that the ocean's constant conversation soothed him. He knew he would miss it, as he always did, when he had to go back to the Valley. He would miss all of this. He was lucky to have ended up here, in Oregon, rather than some podunk university somewhere, a place with no credentials and no budget to send him anywhere. Oregon State University liked his background, despite the controversies, and for the most part, the administration left him alone. He was able to choose his dig sites, and his assistants, and use university funds to continue his research. Fortunately for him, his research centered on the Native American tribes of the Oregon Coast, and he got to spend his summers, and an occasional winter, in what he considered to be the most beautiful place on Earth.<br><br>But he was getting older. The morning chill got into his bones these days. In September, he would turn sixty, and lately, he had begun to feel it. Sleeping in a tent, even with a thick sleeping bag and an air mattress (something he wouldn't have considered in the old days), left him stiff and sore. It took a few minutes of movement every morning before his joints stopped creaking.<br><br>No one stirred in the dozen other tents around the small clearing. Twenty-four Oregon State University students had signed up for this dig, more than any other summer. He was having trouble just keeping them all busy. The dig site wasn't big enough for all of them to work at once.<br><br>He grinned. He always woke before his students. On the second day of the dig, most of them had groaned their way through the work, and he hadn't felt old at all. These days students got no exercise, except for the federally mandated stuff in the public schools. Remotes, handheld computers, and the new personal assistants, which were little more than headless robots, ensured that anyone who wanted to spend his life in a chair could do so without any effort at all.<br><br>Bradshaw was an old-fashioned guy, old enough to remember when kids spent their summers outside playing baseball and kick the can until their parents forced them inside. Old enough to remember when color television was an unusual thing. Old enough to remember only three television channels--all free--and changing those channels by twisting a dial. When he was a little, little boy, it had taken him two hands to go from one channel to the other.<br><br>Now some of his students brought their own televisions with them, tiny things that attached to the wrist and changed channels with a soft verbal command. On the first day of the dig, he had Kelly Flynn, his graduate assistant, help him with what he called the Great Electronics Search. He confiscated most of his students' "necessities"--generally, watches that served as small computers, with television, radio, gaming, and Internet capability. He wanted them to focus on the lives of Native Americans before white settlers found this beautiful place. His theory was that if his students were able to think like the tribe that filled this area, they would do better when they searched through the earth for remnants of that life.<br><br>He hated the day of the Great Electronics Search. It made him the most unpopular man in camp for the first week of the dig. But he had done it often enough to know that by the end of the summer, his students would thank him. They would say things like "I really got to enjoy the woods, Doc. I'd never done that before."<br><br>And never would again, he would wager.<br><br>Most of those students would be angry if they knew that Bradshaw always brought his own electronic equipment to the dig site. They would be even more upset if they knew that he spent part of his evenings on-line, keeping track of current research. His favorite on-line site was a place he lurked, a place where some of the best archaeological minds of this generation argued theory in terms that were as far beyond these students as computers were beyond the tribes that once lived in this very spot. Bradshaw's only contribution to the site--for that matter, to most archaeological publications, print or on-line--was to list the location of his dig and the reason he was excavating the site.<br><br>Imagine his surprise when he was awakened this morning by the vibration of his watch against his wrist. He had only set that private computer alarm for messages marked urgent, be they phone, fax, or e-mail.<br><br>This one was an e-mail message, sent only a few hours after he had updated the dig information for the archaeological site. It was from Dr. Leo Cross. Cross was not the world's most famous archaeologist. Bradshaw had no respect for the famous people, the brand names, to whom recognition was more important than research. They usually let their grad students handle the hard work, and then took credit for the findings. No. Cross was the best-known archaeological historian among his peers. They all envied his intuitive ability. It was almost as if the earth spoke to him, revealing to him secrets that none of the others could ever hope to hear.<br><br>The thing that made Cross s...</p><h2>Talisman</h2><p>The Talisman By Sir Walter Scott The Talisman is a novel by Sir Walter Scott. It was published in 1825 as the second of his Tales of the Crusaders, the first being The Betrothed. The Talisman takes place at the end of the Third Crusade, mostly in the camp of the Crusaders in Palestine. Scheming and partisan politics, as well as the illness of King Richard the Lionheart, are placing the Crusade in danger. The main characters are the Scottish knight Kenneth, a fictional version of David of Scotland, Earl of Huntingdon, who returned from the third Crusade in 1190; Richard the Lionheart; Saladin; and Edith Plantagenet, a relative of Richard. During a truce between the Christian armies taking part in the third Crusade, and the infidel forces under Sultan Saladin, Sir Kenneth, on his way to Syria, encountered a Saracen Emir, whom he unhorsed, and they then rode together, discoursing on love and necromancy, towards the cave of the hermit Theodoric of Engaddi. This hermit was in correspondence with the pope, and the knight was charged to communicate secret information. Having provided the travellers with refreshment, the anchorite, as soon as the Saracen slept, conducted his companion to a chapel, where he witnessed a procession, and was recognised by the Lady Edith, to whom he had devoted his heart and sword. He was then startled by the sudden appearance of the dwarfs, and, having reached his couch again, watched the hermit scourging himself until he fell asleep.</p><p>Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott is recognized as one of the foremost European historical novelists. He achieved success with the publishing of his very first novel. His work displays his lucid understanding of human nature.Many legends have accumulated about Saladin, the twelfth-century sultan whose capture of Jerusalem led to the Third Crusade. The Saracen (Arab) leader is said to have performed prodigious feats of valor, to have possessed uncommon wisdom and cunning, and even to have "out-chivalled" the chivalrous Christian knights who opposed him. In THE TALISMAN (1825), Sir Walter Scott, the most popular novelist of his day, contrasts him with a poor but noble Scottish knight in service to Richard Lionheart. Entering the Crusaders' camp in disguise, Saladin saves said knight from the dishonor brought about by various intrigues. In narrating the romance, Robert Whitfield excels at phrasing, which, accompanied by his pleasant voice and British accent, makes this tape pleasant listening. His pace, however, is a bit too brisk for perfect intelligibility, and he seams deaf to the book's rhythms and lyricism.

But hoping to get hitched without a hitch proves overly optimistic: A skull discovered in a cave near the Sanctuary of Artemis, the ancient world&#x2019;s most famous school for girls, is revealed to be the remains of the Hippias, the reviled last tyrant to rule Athens. The Athenians fought the Battle of Marathon to keep this man out of power; he was supposed to have died thirty years ago, in faraway Persia. What are his remains doing outside the city walls? Nico&#x2019;s boss, the great Athenian statesman Pericles, wants answers, and he orders Nico to find them. Worst of all, one of the two Sanctuary students who discovered the skull has been killed, and the other is missing. Can the sleuths solve the interlocked crimes before their wedding?</p><p>is the author of four other Athenian mysteries: <i>The Pericles Commission</i>, <i>The Ionia Sanction</i>, <i>Sacred Games</i>, and <i>Death Ex Machina</i>. He lives in Sydney, Australia, with his wife and two daughters. He blogs at A Dead Man Fell from the Sky, on all things ancient, Athenian, and mysterious.Chapter One<br>&nbsp; <br> Pericles didn&#x2019;t usually keep a human skull on his desk, but there was one there now. The skull lay upon a battered old scroll case, and stared at me with a vacant expression, as if it were bored by the whole process of being dead. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood mute, determined not to mention the skull. Pericles had a taste for theatrics, and I saw no reason to pander to it. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles sat behind the desk, a man of astonishing good looks but for the shape of his head, which was unnaturally elongated. This one blemish seemed a fair bargain for someone on whom the gods had bestowed almost every possible talent, yet Pericles was as vain as a woman about his head and frequently wore a hat to cover it. He didn&#x2019;t at the moment, though; he knew there was no point trying to impress me.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the lengthening silence he eventually said, &#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re wondering why there&#x2019;s a skull on my desk.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was tempted to say, &#x201c;What skull?&#x201d; But I knew he&#x2019;d never believe it. So instead I said, &#x201c;It does rather stand out. A former enemy?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure. You might be right.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked. I thought I&#x2019;d been joking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We have a problem, Nicolaos.&#x201d; Pericles picked up the skull, and set it aside to reveal the case beneath, which he handed to me. &#x201c;This case came with the skull.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned the scroll case this way and that to examine every part without opening the flap. It was made of leather that looked as if it had been nibbled by generations of mice. Clearly it was very old. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The case was the sort that held more than one scroll: five, I estimated from the size, five cylindrical scrolls held side by side. The surface on the back of the case was much less damaged than the front, but dry and cracked; this leather hadn&#x2019;t been oiled in a long time. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said, &#x201c;The case has been lying on its back for many years. Perhaps decades. Probably in a dry place such as a cupboard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles tapped his desk. &#x201c;The skull and the case were sent to Athens by a priestess from the temple at Brauron. Brauron is a fishing village on the east coast. The accompanying note from the priestess who sent it said that two girl-children had discovered a complete skeleton in a cave, and that lying beside it was this case. For what macabre reason the priestess thought we&#x2019;d want the skull I can&#x2019;t imagine, but the contents of the case is of interest. Open the flap.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside were four scrolls, and one empty slot. I removed one of the scrolls and unrolled it a little. I was worried the parchment might be brittle and crack, but it rolled well enough despite its age. This was high quality papyrus, no doubt imported at great expense from Egypt.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I read a few words, then a few more, unwinding as I did. The scroll was full of dates, places, people. Notes of obvious sensitivity. I saw the names of men who I knew for a fact had died decades ago. Whatever this was, it dated from before the democracy. In fact, if what I read was genuine, these notes referred to the years when Athens was ruled by a tyrant, and the author&#x2014;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked up at Pericles, startled.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He read my expression. &#x201c;I believe you&#x2019;re holding the private notes of Hippias, the last tyrant of Athens.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hippias had ruled many years before I was born. He was so hated that men still spoke about how awful he was; so hated that the people had rebelled against him. He ran to the Persians, who sent an army to reinstate him, so they could rule over Athens via the deposed tyrant. The Athenians and Persians had met upon the beach at Marathon, where we won a mighty victory to retain our freedom. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I held in my hands the private notes of the man who forced us to fight the Battle of Marathon. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was only one problem, and I voiced it. &#x201c;But all the stories say that Hippias died among the Persians, after they were defeated.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We may be revising that theory.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Then the skull is&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles held up the skull to face me. He waggled it like a puppet and said, &#x201c;Say hello to Hippias, the Last Tyrant of Athens.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you sure about this, Pericles?&#x201d; I asked. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We moved over to two dining couches Pericles kept in the room. He&#x2019;d sent a slave for watered wine. Now we sat in the warm sunlight that streamed through the window overlooking the courtyard, sipped the wine, and discussed the strange case of a man who&#x2019;d been dead for thirty years. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure of none of it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why you&#x2019;re here. I&#x2019;m not the only one asking questions. The skull and case were sent in the first instance to the Basileus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The post of Basileus was one of the most important, his job to oversee all festivals, public ceremonies, and major temples. A priestess who wanted to bring something to the attention of the authorities would naturally go to him first.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles continued, &#x201c;The Basileus took it to his fellow archons who manage the affairs of Athens, and they in turn brought it to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded. &#x201c;Yes, of course.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a strange fact that Pericles, who wielded enormous influence, held no official position at all. The source of his power was that melodious voice, and his astonishing ability to speak in public. Men who would otherwise be considered perfectly rational had been known to listen to Pericles as if bewitched, and then do whatever he said. In the <i>ecclesia</i>, where the Athenians met to decide what was to be done, Pericles needed only to make a mild suggestion, and every man present would vote for it. Conversely if Pericles disapproved of someone&#x2019;s proposal, it had no hope of passing a vote. It had reached the point that no one bothered to introduce legislation without first getting his backing. That a man with no official position wielded so much power had become a source of unease among many of the better families, as well as among the elected officials, who were intensely jealous of his easy command.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles said, &#x201c;It was agreed this had to be investigated, and incredible as it may seem, your name was mentioned. The recent events at Olympia have gone some way to repairing your reputation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#x2019;d been unpopular with the archons for some time, ever since I&#x2019;d accidentally destroyed the agora during my first investigation. One archon had even called me an evil spirit sent to harass Athens, which I thought somewhat cruel. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Reputation matters,&#x201d; Pericles said, echoing my own thoughts. &#x201c;Your standing with the older men will be particularly important.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I puzzled over that, then asked, &#x201c;Why, Pericles?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Because they&#x2019;re the only ones who can tell you anything about Hippias. The tyrant belonged to their generation. Not ours. So don&#x2019;t do anything to annoy them, Nicolaos.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;In particular, show the greatest respect to those who fought at Marathon.&#x201d; Pericles paused before going on. &#x201c;You know that Hippias was at Marathon, on the Persian side?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Persians tried to reinstall Hippias as tyrant over us. The veterans stopped them. You must treat the veterans with care, Nicolaos. They&#x2019;re old men now, and respected, and powerful. The veterans tell a story, that after the battle at Marathon, a signal was flashed to the enemy from behind our own lines. The rumor of a traitor among us has persisted ever since. They say one of the great families of Athens secretly supported Hippias the tyrant.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Is it true?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How in Hades should I know? That&#x2019;s your job. I tell you only because this discovery is sure to revive the rumors. We don&#x2019;t need men finding reasons to accuse each other of treason. We especially don&#x2019;t need it when the elections are due next month.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No, we didn&#x2019;t. The other cities closely watched our grand experiment with democracy. It was in everyone&#x2019;s interest, not only Pericles&#x2019;s, that the voting go smoothly and without trouble. If there was any problem at all during the elections, the other cities would say it was because our form of government was unnatural. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pericles said, &#x201c;When word gets out about this body&#x2014;and it will!&#x2014;everyone will demand answers.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Will they? This happened thirty years ago, Pericles. It&#x2019;s ancient history. Nobody cares.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I thought too. But I was wrong. I&#x2019;m afraid, Nicolaos, that I&#x2019;ve made one of my rare blunders. I&#x2019;ve sat on this skull and these scrolls for ten days and done nothing about them; I didn&#x2019;t call you in because I thought, like you, that they didn&#x2019;t matter. But somebody cares. Somebody cares a great deal.&#x201d; Pericles shifted in his seat and looked distinctly uncomfortable. &#x201c;I told you two girls found the skeleton.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;One of them&#x2019;s been killed. They say the child was torn apart by some terrible force&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Dear Gods!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;And the other girl&#x2019;s missing.&#x201d;</p><h2>Masterpieces in Miniature: Engraved Gems from Prehistory to the Present (The Philip Wilson Gems and Jewellery Series)</h2><p>The creation of miniature intaglios - or incised carvings - which could be impressed on clay or wax was one of the earliest crafts of civilisation. To this the Greeks added relief cameos, while comparable skills were lavished on the decoration of metal finger rings. These artefacts record subjects of significance for their period and place but are also the direct expression of an artist&#39;s skills and imagination. Engraved gems were collected first by the ancient Romans and then throughout the Renaissance were a source for knowledge of `classical&#39; subjects and styles, when they were copied - from Michelangelo to Rubens - by the foremost artists of the day. The gemstones explored here are from a distinguished collection made in the earlier twentieth century by a notable connoisseur of ancient art. Many originate from named older European collections and were previously unknown to scholars and collectors. The authors have sought to offer a balanced selection of earlier eastern and Greek stones, alongside others from the neo-classical era.

He earned a B.F.A. at the School of Visual Arts and trained at the Chatauqua School of Art. </p>Mann (The Great Wall, 1997, etc.) offers the older end of the picture-book set a concrete, engaging narrative on another of the man-made wonders of the world. Opening her tale with the failure of the French, under Ferdinand de Lesseps, to construct their own canal in Panama, Mann quickly moves into the details of President Teddy Roosevelt's obsession with the project; he broke international law by encouraging and aiding Panama's rebellion for independence in 1903. The resulting treatythough unfair to Panamagave Roosevelt all the leverage he needed, and despite yellow fever and malaria, America soon poured thousands of workers and millions of dollars into this enterprise. While there were excellent living conditions for American workers in Panama, those conditions were not duplicated for Caribbean laborers: ``Black Caribbeans suffered a higher rate of death from accidents and disease than any other group.'' Rangel's lavish full-color illustrations capture the immense scale of the canal's construction, from the damming of the Chagres River to the construction of the locks on a four-page, fold-out spread. Mann and Rangel have created an exceptional resource for the classroom, as well as an epic piece of storytelling.

Although he and Franklin were frequent correspondents, his name is not mentioned once in Franklin's autobiography. To quote the preface to Colden's papers published by the New-York Historical Society, "had Cadwallader Colden been a patriot to the Cause of the American Revolution instead of a staunch Loyalist and upholder of the Crown his name to-day would have shared equal honors with the men of his time such as Benjamin Franklin. . . . As a matter of fact he was the most learned man in the colonies during his long public service. . . . He was an important factor in settling Boundary disputes. . . . His interest in the native Indians was very great and he had distinct ideas as to the management of Indian affairs which led him as early as 1727 to publish his History of Five Indian Nations. <p> In political matters, however, Colden was a royalist so narrow in his views, so rigid, and so concerned about his personal rights and privileges as lieutenant governor that even men of his own party considered him an obstinate old fool. </p><p> According to New York historian Michael Kammen, "While the <i>vox populi</i> grew in volume, royal authority was on the wane, and the figure who must bear much of the responsibility for undermining it is Cadwallader Colden. The irony, of course, is that this intelligent man, who served intermittently as acting governor and lieutenant governor between 1760 and 1775, wanted nothing so much as to uphold the royal prerogative. Despite all of his political maneuvering, he lacked politique; and for all of his vast learning, he remained one of the most na�ve and tactless figures in the British colonies. It would not be unfair to call him an unwitting provocateur of the early revolutionary movement in New York." </p><p> The place in history of his daughter Jane, however, has emerged since the last half of the twentieth century and the increasing interest in social history and the role of women. In 1963, the Garden Club of Orange and Dutchess Counties published a selection of fifty-seven of Jane's descriptions of species native to North America in a limited edition of fifteen hundred copies in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Garden Club of America. They were chosen because they were of familiar common plants or those of particular interest, such as native orchids, or because the descriptions best illustrated Jane's "remarkable powers of observation and description." The Jane Colden Native Plant Sanctuary was named in her honor at the Knox's Headquarters State Historic Site in Vails Gate, New York.</p></p><p>In eighteenth-century America, "A female botanist was a rare thing to contemplate," according to Raymond Phineas Stearns in his 1970 compendium, <i>Science in the British Colonies of North America.&nbsp; </i>The daughter of the colonial lieutenant governor of the colony of New York and a naturalist well known to the international circle of botanists, Jane Colden became her father's protege. She corresponded regularly with several of her father's friends, exchanging information about plants. Jane produced an herbal describing in both words and drawings 341 plants that grew in and around her father's 3,00acre estate west of Newburgh, New York.&nbsp; The manuscript now resides in the Natural History Museum in London.Paula Ivaska Robbins has combined her love of history with her interest in the natural world to write another book about the history of botanical discovery to join <i>The Travels of Peter Kalm, Finnish-Swedish Naturalist Through Colonial North America</i> (Purple Mountain Press, 2007).

And down, down, down, beneath a theater known as the Sovereign, there sits a long-forgotten architect's model -- the Sovereign's miniature replica. In this secret space, an adorable troupe of theater mice busily prepare to stage their own show, "<i>Broadway Airs</i>." Among the cast and crew are Emil, the director; Harold, the character actor; Adelaide, the diva; and young Pippin, the intern. Rehearsals are in their usual state of chaos when suddenly the production is threatened by the imminent demolition of the theater and the devastating disappearance of Adelaide. As the clock ticks toward opening night, everyone is worried -- will the little Sovereign survive? How can they pull off the most important night in mouse theater without their star? Somehow, the show must go on! </p> <p> In this loving spoof of life in the theater, we join a delightful cast, follow a daring adventure, and welcome a brave new hero. This delicious tribute to the Broadway musical is written by two bestselling authors who have firsthand experience of this much-adored world. </p></p><p><p> Julie Andrews Edwards is one of the most recognized figures in the world of entertainment.

Edwards and her daughter have teamed up to create an affectionate spoof of New York theater life featuring a cast of mice who perform in a tiny theater, located in a forgotten area of an old, once-exquisite theater built for humans. New Year's Eve is approaching and along with it the wrecking ball, leaving the mice just enough time to produce one last musical revue, <i>Broadway </i>Airs. When the show's star, diva Adelaide, disappears into a mouse trap and is transported to Brooklyn, the cast does its best to work around her. In the meantime, Adelaide undertakes an arduous journey back to Times Square--arriving at the theater just in time for her dramatic final number. The mice are clever and appealing without being saccharine, the local color is well done, and the show-biz jokes are sure to keep young theater buffs rolling in the aisles.

This book gathers more than 40 economic, agricultural, and environmental experts to convey a complete picture of how globalization will affect our lives.</p><p>"Economic globalization," writes Jerry Mander, "involves arguably the most fundamental redesign of the planet's political and economic arrangements since at least the Industrial Revolution. Yet the profound implications of these fundamental changes have barely been exposed to serious public scrutiny or debate.

From which omission arises <i>The Case Against the Global Economy</i>.<p> The 43 essays in this collection comprise a point-by-point analysis of globalization and its consequences that demonstrates that the future may not be as bright as business leaders tell us. Among the highlights: William Greider examines how General Electric works to shape (with the goal of controlling) the political arena; Ralph Nader and Lori Wallach attack NAFTA and GATT for undermining the sovereign authority of democratic governments; and Wendell Berry looks at the concerted efforts of big business to destroy local, particularly rural, communities in order to plunder the environment without opposition.

Jack Anderson, a Danish diplomat in pre-Gorbachev Moscow, is determined to discover the truth behind the death of his secretary Sonia, who is found in her bathtub, her wrists slit; on her bed lies the corpse of a sadomasochistic prostitute. Soviet officials are content to call it a murder-suicide, so Jack, sniffing the possibility of a coverup, resorts to illegal tactics. Adding to the puzzle is the revelation that Sonia had been smuggling porno tapes into Moscow, to be sold on the black market. Becoming deeply enmeshed in the seamy underbelly of the city, Jack meets the dead prostitute's sister--the exotic, enigmatic Lilli, a lounge singer. She inadvertently leads him into a trap, getting him fired just when he's close to exposing a connection between Sonia and an ambitious ministerial counselor also at the Danish embassy. Lilli teaches Jack the sobering lesson of corruption: that everyone is for sale, even those in love. Their inevitable split and unrealistic reunion, however, indicate a sudden lack of authorial innovation which undermines an otherwise solid novel. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Horse&#39;s Mouth</h2><p>Joyce Cary wrote two trilogies, or triptychs as he later preferred to call them.

Introduction by Heinrich B�ll. A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book<br></p><p>At&nbsp;the time of Kirov's murder, Eugenia Semyonovna Ginzburg was 27 years old, a happily married mother of three children, a loyal party member, and a schoolteacher and journalist in Kazan in eastern Russia. At that time, also, there was published a four-volume History of the All-Union Communist Party, which, in its coverage of the 1905 Czarist terrors, displeased Stalin; it contained certain "errors" in connection with the theory of permanent revolution. Professor Nikolai Naumovich Elvov, who had written the offending passage, also happened to be the author of a source book on Tartar history. Incredibly, Mrs. Ginzburg was arrested and denounced as a Trotskyite and counter-revolutionary because she had failed to write a review for her publication denouncing Elvov's Tartar book. In short, the masters of a Brechtian netherworld of logical non-reason accused her of not doing something she had not done&#x2014;and of course she could not deny not doing it.Text: English, Russian (translation)</p><h2>The Rainmaker</h2><p>It's summer in Memphis.&nbsp;&nbsp;The sweat is sticking to Rudy Baylor's shirt and creditors are nipping at his heels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once he had aspirations of breezing through law school and punching his ticket to the good life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he doesn't have a job or a prayer...except for one: an insurance dispute that leaves a family devastated and opens the door for a lawsuit, if Rudy can find a way to file it.<br><br>By the time Rudy gets to court, a heavyweight corporate defense team is there to meet him. And suddenly he's in over his head, plunged into a nightmare of lies and legal maneuverings.&nbsp;&nbsp;A case that started small is exploding into a thunderous million-dollar war of nerves, skill and outright violence--a fight that could cost one young lawyer his life, or turn him into the biggest rainmaker in the land....<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Michael Beck (<i>The Golden Seal</i>, <i>Xanadu</i>), who seems to be making a career out of reading books on audio (<i>A Time to Kill</i>, <i>The Runaway Jury</i>), has returned with John Grisham's <i>The Rainmaker</i>, bringing the backwoods of Tennessee's legal world to life. His sultry, southern drawl animates the world of Rudy Baylor, an out-of-luck, budding lawyer who has more things going against him than bedraggled, disaster-magnet Joe from <i>Lil' Abner</i>. The law firm that hired Baylor was gobbled up by a larger firm just three weeks before his graduation, and now he has no job and no chance of finding one. To make matters worse, when he gets home there's an eviction notice, a process server, and a lawsuit waiting for him. What's a bumbling baby-lawyer to do? Get a case and some cold hard cash--fast. Baylor stumbles upon two possible jackpots: A tight-lipped widow with millions squirreled away and a young man whose life is cut short by a negligent insurance company. Baylor gets in over his head and finds himself up against a pack of superpower attorneys; losing could cost him his life and winning would make him a rainmaker cum laude. Grisham's knack for making tedious legalities interesting, coupled with Beck's gift for shifting in and out character like a Mercedes roadster, makes for an exciting, entertaining listen. Running time: 360 minutes."Grisham's sixth spellbinding novel of legal intrigue and corporate greed displays all of the intricate plotting, fast-paced action, humor, and suspense that have made him the most popular author of our time. In his first courtroom thriller since <i>A Time To Kill</i>, John Grisham tells the story of a young man barely out of law school who finds himself taking on one of the most powerful, corrupt, and ruthless companies in America -- and exposing a complex, multibillion-dollar insurance scam. In hs final semester of law school Rudy Baylor is required to provide free legal advice to a group of senior citizens, and it is there that he meets his first "clients," Dot and Buddy Black. Their son, Donny Ray, is dying of leukemia, and their insurance company has flatly refused to pay for his medical treatments. While Rudy is at first skeptical, he soon realizes that the Blacks really have been shockingly mistreated by the huge company, and that he just may have stumbled upon one of the largest insurance frauds anyone's ever seen -- and one of the most lucrative and important cases in the history of civil litigation. The problem is, Rudy's flat broke, has no job, hasn't even passed the bar, and is about to go head-to-head with one of the best defense attorneys -- and powerful industries -- in America.</p><h2>DEATH OF AN ARMY (Wordsworth Military Library)</h2><p>In October, 1914, all that stood between the advancing German Army and the English Channel was the British Expeditionary Force.

All was silence within the crumbling stone walls where she had slept.Real sheets, not virtual, were bunched around her legs; she clutched a pillow and watched the faint radiance of dawn swing down from the eastern sky. Around and about her, within the walls and ceiling and floating on every minuscule speck of dust, a thousand other eyes watched. To them she might seem like a figure of porcelain, her mop of fair hair touched only now and then by an errant breeze. So still was she that to those ubiquitous eyes and monitors, she might seem just another fixture of the room.When the rectangle of black from the French doors turned gray, Livia sighed at the ceiling and untangled herself from rest. She walked through the French doors onto the broad stone balcony that encircled the estate's guest apartments. Curled up in one of the old crenels, she looked out over the manicured grounds with their posing topiary and past the indistinct forest tops. Stars still shone, Jupiter on her right, the pastel curves of the Lethe Nebula to her left. It was that time of day when the world seems to pause between breaths--the towering redwood trees that carpeted the hillside were motionless, and all would be silent if not for the chattering of thousands of wakening birds.When the solitude began reminding her of sadder times, she looked out one last time at the empty gardens and then summoned her Society. A hum of voices welled up around her and ghostly figures began appearing above, below, all about; some seemed to stand on the air above the gardens. Each luminous person acknowledged her with a wave, a smile, or a bow. Some were engaged in conversation, some stood alert but motionless. Livia didn't want to talk to any of the real inhabitants of the estate right now, so she excluded them from her sensorium. For now, she was alone with her phantoms.Mother's anima waved from an unlikely perch on one of the window lintels. "Up with the dawn today, Liv?" She laughed. "We have to drag you out of bed back home!"She shrugged. "I need time to review my animas, that's all."Livia strolled back to her bedchamber, hesitating by the dresser. She slept in the nude, and could easily eschew clothing for the day if it proved to be as hot as it was threatening; by default, she would appear dressed to anyone she met. Such informality didn't feel quite right when she was a guest in this house. Livia donned her shift and tuned it to resemble a Tharsis corset and voluminous silk pantaloons as she walked to the bathroom.Conversations bubbled around her as she scowled at the mirror. Some dialogues were happening now in the manor, but most were the peers, laughing and chattering in diverse places back home. Some voices were real people's; some were imitations performed by AIs. They were filtered for relevance by Livia's agents so that she only got the gist of what was happening today: <i>"Devari has a new opera, but he won't show it to anyone. Claims he'll fall out of the manifold if he does!" (Laughter.) "We went flying yesterday. You should have seen Jon! He was practically blue." "What, he'd never been before?"</i><i>"Livia, we all heard about your performance last night. You've finally mastered that Mozart aria, congratulations!"</i><i>"Have you heard? Aaron Varese has vanished!"</i>Livia had been crossing the room to her door. She stopped, looking for whoever had just spoken. It was raven-haired Esther Mannus, one of the most active peers; not the real woman, for she was back home in Barrastea, but rather her anima, which she regularly updated. She was laughing with an indistinct friend--someone not of Livia's Society, but not hostile to it either."Excuse me." The two phantoms swooped into tighter focus, almost becoming real enough to be opaque. Esther covered her smiling mouth with one hand. "Ah, Livia," said the anima. "We thought you'd heard already.""Heard what?""Why, that Aaron has left the city and won't speak to anyone."Livia had worried that something like this would happen. She said, "I'd wondered why he wasn't with me this morning. What's he working on this time?"Esther glanced around, then said quietly, "Something to do with 'science,' whatever that is. He was babbling on about traveling through space last time we spoke." She sighed. "We're used to his provocations. But we also know that whatever he's up to, you're involved."Livia shook her head. "Not this time." She didn't add that she and Aaron had been drifting apart lately. Anyway, it wasn't unheard-of for someone to isolate himself; everybody did now and then, just for sanity's sake. Still, no animas of Aaron had appeared in her Society this morning. Not to leave one behind was definitely an affront and maybe a deliberate insult. It was disturbing.A tiny whistle sounded from the doorway. She saw a flicker of light there, whirling in circles near the latch."Coming," she said. As she went to the door, Livia kept Esther's animabeside her. "I'll go speak to him," she said. "In person. Maybe he has a good explanation for this."Esther nodded. "I won't downgrade his anima until I hear from you, then," she said tartly. Livia nodded and dismissed the phantom.Her two favorite agents were waiting at the door. Since they were not physically real, but rather images painted on her senses by her neural implants, she could make them look like anything she wanted. She'd always had them appear as tiny faeries. The first one, Peaseblossom, said, "You were very busy last night!" in a pipsqueak voice. Cicada muscled Peaseblossom out of the way and proclaimed, "You were all over the place!" And in unison: "We think you're in trouble!""Oh, great," she said. "What did I do?""Jachman and his friends were scheming against Rene," said Peaseblossom, its wings a blur. "They didn't know you have the hots for him.""I do not!""You do. Jachman had your anima open while he was talking to the others, and you challenged him.""To a <i>duel</i>!"Livia groaned and put her hand to her forehead. "I did what?""That's not all!" Cicada puffed out his little chest in pride. "At the selfsame time, you were defending Aaron's honor at a party across town!""The duel," she pressed. "What happened with the duel?" She strolled down the manor's marble steps, following the scent of fresh bacon that was drifting toward her."You fought Jachman, and he killed you," said Peaseblossom. "It's gonna cost you."It certainly would. She was bound to lose some authority over this spat. If she'd been there in person ...She dismissed the idea as wishful thinking. If her anima had fought a duel, then Livia herself almost certainly would have done so had she been there in its place. Animas might only be imitations of people, but they were very accurate imitations."Okay," she said. "I'm going to have to visit that incident. You've got it ready for me?""Any time you say.""After breakfast, then."Cicada made an exaggerated gesture of toeing the ground (he was a meter in the air). "Well, I'm not sure you'll have the time," he said reluctantly."What do you mean?" She stopped and glared at the little man. "What else did I do last night?""You made a date with Lucius Xavier," said Cicada.She gaped at him.Peaseblossom elbowed his companion fiercely. "Not a <i>date</i>," he hissed. "Xavier's not that kind of friend." He cleared his throat and smiled up at Livia. "You agreed to meet him here this morning. In person, that is. You're going hunting Impossibles, remember?""No, I ..." Oh. Was that what his visit had been about?To be strictly polite, Livia should not have had her Society up during last night's soiree. After all, she was a physical guest of the Romanal estate, not just a virtual visitor. She owed her host and hostess her undivided attention at least during supper. Their daughter's confirmation as a true citizen of Westerhaven was important to them and Livia's own family had ties with theirs going back generations.So she had gone through supper and cocktails completely present, and sung her set with her Society absent. Only afterward had she answered the urgent summons of an old family friend, to take a walk in the estate's garden with his virtual self.Now she made herself visible and entered the guest house's kitchens. Here was Lady Romanal, her host, cheerfully flipping eggs on the giant gas stove in the corner. This, the real Lady Romanal, was talking to an anima of Livia herself, while her own anima chatted with another of the guests, Livia's violin player. The violin player was a taciturn man who looked uneasy under the lady's microscope. Livia had never really gotten along with him outside of a professional capacity. She split off an anima to join his side of the conversation and walked to the stove, quickly back-stepping through her other anima's conversation with the lady until she felt prepared.Then she replaced her own image at the lady's side. "Our politics aren't that radical," she said. "Aaron and I simply think Westerhaven's become too complacent. Too ... calm."Lady Romanal sighed. "But is that a real criticism, or just youth speaking? Bacon?""Yes, thank you.""You know what kind of reputation you'll get if you continue this pointless agitation," continued Lady Romanal. She was sweating from the heat, but seemed to enjoy cooking for these, her least important guests. "Your mother is quite concerned.""Concern is Mother's chief talent," said Livia as she held out a plate."Oh, you are a handful!" complained the lady cheerfully. "Is it true you've been advocating that we should all abandon our manifolds and live together?""That was Aaron, not me. He doesn't see why we should deliberately limit our realities.""Delightful!"Livia glowered at her. "He takes his politics very seriously. So do I."Lady Romanal smiled as she piled food on Livia's plate. "Maybe that's your problem. Too serious to be serious, if you catch my meaning." When Livia didn't answer she said, "Perhaps it's time to put the past behind you, Livia."Livia left her anima to continue the conversation and went to sit down. That was a bit rude, but only a bit. Lady Romanal should know what subjects were sensitive to her.As the kitchen filled up with other performers and incidental guests, Livia turned her attention to last night's adventures. She should review that duel, but didn't relish the prospect of watching herself lose. She should also loose some agents to hunt for Aaron. Instead, she back-stepped into her conversation with Lucius."No, there's no emergency," he'd said as she sat down on a bench in the garden next to his virtual self. "But I'd like you here, if you can oblige me."Livia had glanced at the party, decided she was safely alone for the moment, and replaced her own sensorium with the one at Lucius's locale. He too stood outside, but on a wide balcony a hundred meters above the city of Barrastea. The buzz of night bugs was replaced here by the incessant murmur of the city, whose glittering lights spread away to the horizon and reared here and there halfway to the zenith. Livia made the anima she now inhabited move to peck him on the cheek."How are you, Lucius?" she began.He smiled at her in a distracted way. In this light he looked like a slightly shabby, careworn Poseidon, his hair and beard all atangle. "It's been too long since we talked," he said at last."That wouldn't happen if you didn't travel so much." She sat her virtual self down on a stone seat near him."It's my responsibility," he said, frowning into the night. "I sometimes don't like it much. But we're diplomats and ambassadors in Westerhaven, Livia--all of us, whether or not we want to simply stay at home and tend our gardens.""Is that what you want to do?""Sometimes." He brightened a bit. "But not always. Sometimes an adventure beckons. Like tonight. That's why I called you--I wanted a traveling companion for a day-trip, and couldn't think of anybody else who might want to go with me on it.""No? That seems unlikely."At about this point Livia had been interrupted by some members of Romanal's party spilling out into the gardens. She had severed her connection to Lucius, leaving an anima behind, so she didn't know what had happened next.She watched now as Lucius laughed. "You know perfectly well that most people run in tracks. We may be a manifold dedicated to bridging the gaps between other manifolds, but when push comes to shove, nobody you or I know has the courage to travel anywhere really exotic. Not across a real horizon, that's for sure."Livia's anima (which she now observed from outside) looked intrigued, but a little disturbed. "You want to cross a horizon? To where?""I'm not sure. But I'd like you to come with me, if you would."There was a pause. Livia's anima appeared surprised and confused. After a moment it said, "Please tell me that you thought of me because wherever you're going is a musical manifold.""No," he said, looking momentarily guilty. "I know you don't like to be reminded of the accident, Livia, but it did give you a unique perspective that--"Her anima stood up angrily. "Lucius, how could you? I will not travel outside of inscape again for you, or anybody else! Or to any manifold that doesn't use it. You of all people should know ..." She turned away.Lucius reached out to touch her virtual shoulder. "This won't be like that, I swear. I'm not proposing we leave inscape, or any of the manifolds you know. I just want to take a walk along the border of Westerhaven. Tomorrow. And I think you should come."She turned, suspicious. "Why?"He shrugged. "It might improve your authority. Won't hurt mine either. You see, people have been sighting Impossibles near the Romanal estate. It's been going on for several weeks now. So far it's all anecdotal; nobody's inscape has preserved a record. It's as if they're being seen by the eyes only, without the inscape system being aware of them at all."Livia's anima shuddered. The mere idea of inscape having problems made her nervous--would make anyone raised in Westerhaven squirm. No wonder Lucius couldn't find anyone to join him on his little expedition."What are they seeing?" her anima asked, turning back to face him. Livia was a bit surprised that she hadn't turned him down outright; shemight have if she'd been there in person. Then again, she might not. Animas tended to know the personalities of those they modeled better than the people themselves."Mythical creatures," said Lucius. "Bears and wolves that walk like men. Giant birds with masklike faces. They sound like Raven's people. All I want to do is verify that the sightings are genuine and not some kind of hysterical meme. I have no intention of going anywhere near one of the things, believe me.""And you want me along because ...""After the things you've seen, Livia, I think you...</p><h2>Giant Tomatoes</h2><p>Giant Tomatoes is the first book on tomatoes that deals exclusively with growing tomatoes for size and yield.

However, Nathaniel Ford, an influential settler and legislator, kept them in bondage until 1850, even then refusing to free their children. Holmes took his former master to court and, in the face of enormous odds, won the case in 1853. <br><br>In <i>Breaking Chains</i>, R. Gregory Nokes tells the story of the only slavery case adjudicated in Oregon&#x2019;s pre-Civil War courts&#x2014;Holmes v. Ford. Through the lens of this landmark case, Nokes explores the historical context of racism in Oregon and the West, reminding readers that there actually were slaves in Oregon, though relatively few in number.<br><br>Drawing on the court record, Nokes offers an intimate account of the relationship between a slave and his master from the slave&#x2019;s point of view. He also explores the experiences of other slaves in early Oregon, examining attitudes toward race and revealing contradictions in the state&#x2019;s history. Oregon was the only free state admitted to the union with a voter-approved constitutional clause banning African Americans and, despite the prohibition of slavery in the state, many in Oregon tolerated it and supported politicians who advocated for slavery, including Oregon&#x2019;s first territorial governor. <br><br><i>Breaking Chains</i> sheds light on a somber part of Oregon&#x2019;s history, bringing the story of slavery in Oregon to a broader audience.

Denzin characterized Lonnie Athens's earlier work<br> as "the most far-reaching, provocative, and profound analysis of violent conduct" available in criminological literature. In <i>Violent Criminal Acts and Actors Revisited,</i> Athens returns to his pioneering work and finds that his premises are just as relevant and original as in their earlier version--and that they have been curiously, and to society's detriment, overlooked.<br> Rather than finding the causes of criminal behavior in external forces<br> or personality disorders, as conventional wisdom often does, Athens renews his fundamental argument that a violent situation comes into being when defined by an individual as a situation that calls for violence--that an actor responds to the circumstance as he or she defines it.

Understanding China's foreign policy means fully appreciating these geostrategic challenges, which persist even as the country gains increasing influence over its neighbors. Andrew J. Nathan and Andrew Scobell analyze China's security concerns on four fronts: at home, with its immediate neighbors, in surrounding regional systems, and in the world beyond Asia. By illuminating the issues driving Chinese policy, they offer a new perspective on the country's rise and a strategy for balancing Chinese and American interests in Asia. <br><br>Though rooted in the present, Nathan and Scobell's study makes ample use of the past, reaching back into history to illuminate the people and institutions shaping Chinese strategy today. They also examine Chinese views of the United States; explain why China is so concerned about Japan; and uncover China's interests in such problematic countries as North Korea, Iran, and the Sudan. The authors probe recent troubles in Tibet and Xinjiang and explore their links to forces beyond China's borders. They consider the tactics deployed by mainland China and Taiwan, as Taiwan seeks to maintain autonomy in the face of Chinese advances toward unification. They evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of China's three main power resources&#x2015;economic power, military power, and soft power. <br><br>The authors conclude with recommendations for the United States as it seeks to manage China's rise. Chinese policymakers understand that their nation's prosperity, stability, and security depend on cooperation with the United States.

It was also a transformative event that freed nearly 4 million slaves and changed the nation. This volume examines the aftermath of the Civil War, including the assassination of Lincoln, amnesty, constitutional amendments, Reconstruction, Compromise, Disenfranchisement, and the lasting legacy for all Americans.</p><p></p><h2>Compassionate Mind Approach To Recoverin</h2><p>Terrible events are very hard to deal with and those who go through a trauma often feel permanently changed by it. Grief, numbness, anger, anxiety and shame are all very common emotional reactions to traumatic incidents such as an accident or death of a loved one, and ongoing traumatic events such as domestic abuse. How we deal with the aftermath of trauma and our own emotional response can determine how quickly we are able to &#39;move on&#39; and get back to &#39;normality&#39; once more. An integral part of the recovery process is not only recognising and accepting how our lives may have been changed but also learning to deal with feelings of shame - an extremely common reaction to trauma. &#34;Recovering from Trauma&#34; uses the groundbreaking Compassion Focused Therapy to help the reader to not only develop a fuller understanding of how we react to trauma, but also to deal with any feelings of shame and start to overcome any trauma-related difficulties.</p><p>Dr Deborah Lee is a Consultant Clinical Psychologist and Head of the Berkshire Traumatic Stress Service.

Enjoy the simple things in life-with colors and patterns that your whole family will love.</p><p>Growing up in a home brimming with creativity and quilts, it was only natural that Camille Roskelley started designing her own quilts and fabrics. Visit her popular blog, Simplify, at camilleroskelley.typepad.com. She lives in Nevada.From an early age Camille Roskelley the author of Simplify:Quilts for the Modern Home (Camille Roskelley/Stash Books (C&amp;T Publishing) was making quilts, it seemed as though she always had a quilting project in the works. This was more than just a passing fancy for her and these early childhood inspirations can be seen in the products she designs for her company Thimble Blossoms. Now more than a hobby, from 2007 until now, she has created over 40 original quilt patterns. In 2008 Camille and her mother(Bonnie Olaveson) were approached by Moda and asked to design fabric, this collaboration has produced three lines of fabric; Cotton Blossoms, Simple Abundance, and Bliss. It is ironic that she would contribute designs to the cornucopia of quilt fabrics on the market, as in her own words, she said When I first began quilting, fabric selection seemed a little overwhelming to walk into a store and just know what would look great together? Forget about it. Somewhere along the line I was introduced to a charm pack and it was love at first sight. Indeed charm packs make life simpler for not just beginning quilters but experienced ones as well. For those unfamiliar with the term, charm packs consist of 5*5 squares of coordinating fabric from the same collection of fabric and typically contain 25-40 squares in the bundle. Besides charm packs Camille also explains common quilting supply terms, such as layer cakes, jelly rolls, honey buns, turnovers, and fat quarters. She also gives a nice concise list of necessary and optional tools, from this simple start she gently leads the reader into projects of increasing complexity. Those loyal enough to stick with her to the end will walk away a different quilter than they were when they started. I highly recommend that if you have an interest in quilting that you add this wonderful book to your library. Camille will teach you how to create such items as: a little boys quilt, a darling sweet pea girl's quilt with a slightly scalloped edging (really cute!),a beautiful spot on quilt (for the polka dot lover), toss pillows in several different designs,and even quilted table toppers,and more. You'll find patterns for all of the projects are included in the back of the book. (Bella Modiste, Small Town Living, 11/2/10)<br><br>Camille Roskelley is one of lucky people who gets to play with fabric while staying at home and get paid for it! A fabric designer, quilt maker and now author, Camille is a talented and busy designer and mother of 2 boys. The quilts in her first book showcase some of her tips for simplifying your life with easy and fun quilts in a variety of sizes - mostly small - baby or table topper quilts (and cushions) there are a couple of slightly more challenging quilts - but mostly the quilts in this book are for the busy crafter who doesn't have time for a lot of fuss and likes to squeeze in a quick quilt in amongst an otherwise hectic schedule.I also like that Camille didn't only stick to using her fabrics in her designs - instead she has branched out and used some collections by her fellow Moda fabric designers - and the quilts in this book use pre-cut fabrics - gotta love those! Also there are a rather large percentage of the quilts in this book catering to a more masculine palette - with 2 boys I guess thats natural!Totally cute book - aimed at the busy or beginner quilter - with a range of simple geometric and traditional block designs - but with a bit of a modern slant. (Whipup.net, 10/16/10)<br><br>Celebrating fabric arts for a handmade lifestyle, Stash Books, an imprint of C&amp;T Publishing, released this book of eight quilt projects and 4 pillow patterns. The author, Camille Roskelley is a young pattern designer, who has designed three fabric lines for Moda with her mom, Bonnie Olaveson. Simplify is designed to build quiltmaking skills with easy-to-make and fun projects that feature pre-cut strips or fat quarters. The text is friendly and fun to read, the projects are cheerful and bright, and the book is sprinkled with Camille's practical Keeping it Simple tips. (Professional Quilter Online, 11/11/10)<br><br>Camille Roskelley, the designer behind Thimble Blossoms label, has created nine quilts and four cushions that are about simple design, simple projects, simple fabric selection. As the mother of two young boys, she's dedicated it to every other mom out there who wants to make something that just stays done. The projects are all based on traditional patchwork with something fresh added to the mix to lift them out of the ordinary: a bow, an unusual boarder treatment, a spot of applique and so on. Camille loves working with pre-cuts (jelly rolls, charm squares) so if you do too, you'll take particular delight in these projects...</p><h2>Moon, Moon: 35th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>This is the 35th Annivesary Edition of the orignal classic book with a new introduction from the author. &#x201c;This book was amazing.

As I began rereading the sections on the moon goddess, I realized that Rush had set before me a feast of images, not scholarship, but evocations of the many faces of the Moon Mother. Suddenly (Navajo) Changing Woman came alive for me and I saw her sitting peacefully at the place of all beginnings....

What emerges is an intriguing inside look at Wellstone's crusade to assert an unabashedly liberal agenda.<p>From the moment he was elected, Wellstone has passionately articulated a path to economic and social justice for all citizens, justice not contingent on the size of a person's bank account or their political influence. A call for personal politics and deep commitment to beliefs, Wellstone's tenure as a U.S. senator has been a vigorous, at times outraged, and always active fight for support for farmers, working families, and other Minnesotans; for decent jobs, improved health care, a good education, and retirement security. At once responding to the conservative hijacking of compassion as a political yardstick and explaining his own political record, Wellstone engagingly elucidates what contrasts conservative and liberal interests and, as always, rouses progressives to influence the future of American politics.</p></p><p>When senators think about running for president, they write books like <i>The Conscience of a Liberal</i>. Indeed, Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota thought about pursuing the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000, but ultimately backed off. Unfortunately, his death in an October 2002 plane crash ended both a promising political career and all speculation about where it might lead.<p>The first part of the book explains Wellstone's unlikely ascension to the Senate (he was once a college professor), and some of his campaign war stories are fun reading for political junkies. One of the most amusing passages describes how he once nearly clocked New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato over a disagreement: "When the train reached the Senate chamber, I jumped out and lunged forward, intending to catch D'Amato and deck him. My body was shaking with uncontrollable anger." Another senator held him back, and Wellstone calmed down.</p><p>The bulk of <i>The Conscience of a Liberal</i>, however, is given over to laying out a political agenda that includes universal health care, reversing welfare reforms, prekindergarten education, raising the minimum wage, and campaign-finance reform. He closes with a call for a new politics: "This is not a conservative America.... There is a huge leadership void in this country that the Democratic Party, emboldened by political courage and a commitment to the issues that made our party great, can fill." Sadly, one of the politicians who helped fill that void is now gone himself. Still, his ideas live on. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>"<b>The Conscience of a Liberal</b> is an absolutely fascinating and compelling work, rich in humor and with unexpected revelations of the backstage machinations that take place within the corridors of power, by a deeply moral man whose private decency and public courage render him unique in civic life. A hero to the young, a reproach to the cynical, a living symbol of clean politics and unadulterated liberal conviction, Wellstone is also a superb gut-fighter and &#x2014; unlike too many jaded liberals &#x2014; he fights to win. It is all here in this vitally exciting story of a man whose anger at injustice never wavers and whose innocence remains untarnished by the exercise of power."<br>&#x2014; Jonathan Kozol, author of <b>Ordinary Resurrections</b><br><br>"Vivid, readable, and grittily honest about how the influence of the money power undermines the liberal agenda. Wellstone's populist commitments shine through. So does his skill and his guts in this account of how one Senator can make a difference.

Reading, who performed Willig's two previous books, knows her characters well.

In this book, the spies, whose aliases include the Pink Carnation and the Purple Gentian, are out to foil the 1803 Irish Rebellion.

Without meaningful regulation, capitalist economies will concentrate wealth in an ever smaller number of hands. For years, this critical challenge to democracy has been the focus of Piketty&#x2019;s monthly newspaper columns, which pierce the surface of current events to reveal the economic forces underneath. <i>Why Save the Bankers?</i> brings together selected columns from the period bookended by the September 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers and the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. In crystalline prose, Piketty examines a wide range of topics, and along the way he decodes the European Union&#x2019;s economic troubles, weighs in on oligarchy in the United States, wonders whether debts actually need to be paid back, and discovers surprising lessons about inequality by examining the career of Steve Jobs.

It has become a commonplace to say that we are living in a second Gilded Age&#x2014;or, as Piketty likes to put it, a second Belle �poque&#x2014;defined by the incredible rise of the &#x2018;one percent.&#x2019; But it has only become a commonplace thanks to Piketty&#x2019;s work . . . The result has been a revolution in our understanding of long-term trends in inequality. Before this revolution, most discussion of economic disparity more or less ignored the very rich. Some economists (not to mention politicians) tried to shout down any mention of inequality at all . . . It therefore came as a revelation when Piketty and his colleagues showed that incomes of the now famous &#x2018;one percent,&#x2019; and of even narrower groups, are actually the big story in rising inequality. And this discovery came with a second revelation: talk of a second Gilded Age, which might have seemed like hyperbole, was nothing of the kind . . . Piketty has transformed our economic discourse. We&#x2019;ll never talk about wealth and inequality the same way we used to.&#x201d; &#x2014; Paul Krugman, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br> &#x201c;Piketty&#x2019;s treatment of inequality is perfectly matched to its moment . . .

Essential garage literature.</p></p><p><p><b>Chris Rooke</b> was brought up in a mechanical family where his father was always tinkering with clocks and engines, and Chris inherited his love of all things mechanical from him. Where he gained his love of motorcycles from is anyone's guess! His first bikes were a Vespa 125 and a Lambretta SX200 at the tender age of 13, followed by a Raleigh Runabout, and then his first 'real' bike - a Casal moped (a rather cheap version of the Yamaha FS1E, made in Portugal) when he was 16. He then bought a BSA Starfire 250 when he turned 17 and this was the first bike he ever rebuilt that went again afterwards! After a short dalliance with a Suzuki Rebel 350, and having the dubious pleasure of sharing a flat with the owner of a 'tired' 1972 Norton Commando Combat 750cc that was off the road more than on, he bought the love of his life - a 1954 Matchless 350 GLS Heavyweight single that he stripped down and turned into a bobber/chopper and this remained his sole means of transport for many years. Sadly that bike was then stolen and after rebuilding a Triumph T100 for a friend he purchased a Triumph Bonneville T140 which was duly rebuilt and pressed into service, but this was soon sold to fund a house purchase (familiar story?) and for many years he remained bikeless. When his fortunes changed for the better he bought an E-Type Jaguar 4.2 FHC Series II which he completely restored form the ground up and formed the basis of his first restoration manual. The whole process took nine years, but as soon as he completed it he was forced to sell it for financial reasons. Undaunted he was then able to buy two Triumph Tridents, a 1973 T150V and a 1975 T160 which he completely restored quickly followed by the iconic Kawasaki Z900, and these form the basis of&nbsp; two further restoration manuals, along with the Essential Buyer's Guide to the Triumph Trident and BSA Rocket III.</p><p>"What we especially like is the friendly, everyday tone ...

The two of them, who would change her life. There was nothing to herald their appearance, no collection of birds or arrangement of tea leaves to mark their arrival. If anything, the convent was more quiet than usual. The nuns had just finished the midmorning service and scattered to their cells for private prayer. The abbess was shut in her chamber.<br>&nbsp;<br>Only the princess was out in the garden, wandering along the stone wall that overlooked the sea. Here, near the old well, the wall dipped down to her knees, and an ancient gate led to a stairway that curved to the rocky beach below. She was bundled in furs, wincing against the blast of wind that swept up from the sea and made the bare trees rattle around her.<br>&nbsp;<br>She was not supposed to be out here. She should have been in her cell, too, but she did not follow the rules the way the others did, and the abbess had instructed them to give her wide berth. No one knew why, only that she &#x2019;d arrived one night on horseback accompanied by three armed guards, who carried in a large chest, placed it in a private double cell in the novices&#x2019; wing, and disappeared as quietly as they&#x2019;d come.<br>&nbsp;<br>No one but the abbess herself knew that she was the Northern king&#x2019;s daughter, that she was in hiding after secret reports that the South would be renewing its attacks. The others knew her simply by the name Mira, which was short for her given name, Margrethe. Most assumed she suffered some kind of ailment or melancholy, and the less committed novices had spent hours over the last months trying to guess which one. A few days after Margrethe&#x2019;s arrival, another new tenant had appeared: a bright, flame- haired girl named Edele, who became fast friends with Margrethe, almost as if they&#x2019;d known each other for years.<br>&nbsp;<br>Margrethe had never wanted to come to this desolate outpost, was not used to the barren loneliness of this part of the world. She missed the castle, the long dinners lit by fire and dancing, the sleigh rides, her childhood room with its little fireplace in which pinecones burned, the mantel lined with books. She especially missed those&#x2014;her books, and the long hours she had spent with her father&#x2019;s adviser and old tutor, Gregor, poring over them, learning of ancient battles and loves and philosophies. But the kingdom was under threat, and this was the safest place for her, her father had said, here at the edge of the world, in the convent that her late grandmother had helped found and that her mother had been schooled in as a girl.<br>&nbsp;<br>She thought of her mother now, as she stared out at this desolate sea. It had been two years since the queen&#x2019;s death, but sometimes it felt as fresh as a new wound. Margrethe pulled her furs close and stood stark against the wind, breathing in the thick air, which coated her tongue in salt. She wondered how her mother had felt staring out at this same sea. Was it like this back then? The ocean dark, wild? It seemed, to Margrethe, the color of grief.<br>&nbsp;<br>Before coming here she had never seen the sea like this, as a living thing. Some trees had been uprooted by a recent storm, and they reached toward the water like gnarled fingers. She strained against the wind, hoping to catch sight of a Viking ship, a square flag, a dragon prow, but she was at the end of the world now, at the most northern point in the kingdom, and no ships came here.<br>&nbsp;<br>How was she to know that this would be the most singular moment of her life? How can any of us tell when that thing comes that will make everything different? It seemed, to Margrethe, a moment like any other: waiting to return to her father&#x2019;s castle, looking over the gloomy sea, waiting for private prayer to be over and the convent workday to start. Strangely, she found herself looking forward to the hours she &#x2019;d spend weaving that afternoon, listening to the clacking of the looms, the hum of the spinning wheels nearby, the voice of one of the sisters reading scripture moving over them. At first she &#x2019;d hated the dull hours of work, but lately she&#x2019;d found a certain comfort in them. She could forget everything, watching the wool transform in front of her.<br>&nbsp;<br>The sky gleamed and shifted. The sun was a dull ache behind a veil of gray and silver.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, there. On the water! She breathed in quickly, afraid it was a trick of the sea. A fish&#x2019;s tail shooting out. Bright, shimmering silver.<br>&nbsp;<br>Margrethe squinted against the cold wind, trying to keep her eyes steady and focused. They say you can see things here, at the end of the world. Faces in the clouds and waves and leaves. Branches becoming arms and then branches again.<br>&nbsp;<br>But there it was again, a flash of white. Margrethe blinked repeatedly, and the sea air seemed to cut through her. She wiped tears from her eyes and cheeks and leaned into the wind. The sea seemed to shift from foam to water, from dark to light, swirling. In the distance, rocks jutted. It would be easy to mistake one for the monstrous fin of a great fish, the prow<br>of a ship sinking down.<br>&nbsp;<br>And then: a curving, gleaming tail flaring out of the water. A moment later, another flash and a pale face emerging, disappearing as quickly as it had appeared. A woman&#x2019;s face. The tail of a fish stretching out behind her. Silvery, as if it were made of gems. Margrethe shook her head. The cold was making her see things.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>She turned to look at the convent behind her, the cross and church spires stretching black against the sky. The other women were inside, next to fires and wrapped in blankets and furs. Only she was crazy enough to stand here staring into this impossible sea.<br>&nbsp;<br>She laughed at herself, turned back to the sea. But the woman was still there, closer now, gliding through the water as if she had wings. Her hair the color of the moon and scattered through with pearls. Her skin shimmering out of the water, catching the light and turning to diamonds. And that tail propelling her forward, unmistakably. It was not human, this creature.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Mermaid. </i>The name came to Margrethe automatically, from the stories that had rooted themselves in her mind, the ancient tales she had read by firelight as the rest of the castle slept. She no longer felt the wind or the cold as she stood transfixed, watching the mermaid move through the water. Margrethe had not known such things could really exist, but the moment she saw the mermaid, it was as if the world had always contained this kind of<br>wonder. <i>This is how it works, </i>she thought. <i>When the world becomes something new, it seems always to have been that way.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>She&#x2019;d never seen anything so beautiful in all her years at court, not in all the grand banquets and dances, the festivals that lasted weeks at a time, the creations of musicians and storytellers, the rich spices and fabrics and jewels shipped in from all over the world. Not in all her years surrounded by handmaidens who bathed her and brushed her hair and laced her corsets and pressed powder into her skin. Nothing could compare to this creature gliding through the water, propelled by the tail of a fish.<br>&nbsp;<br>As the mermaid approached the shore, Margrethe saw that she was carrying something. A man. Holding him in her arms and keeping his head above water. The mermaid slowed as she arrived at the shore, and reached out to the rocky beach. In a graceful rolling movement, the man cradled in one arm, she moved from sea to land. The sharp rocks would have ripped a human&#x2019;s skin, but the mermaid seemed unharmed as she released the man and gently, tenderly, laid him out on the shore next to her, her light hair hanging in long, wet ropes. Now Margrethe could see clearly: the man&#x2019;s muscled warrior&#x2019;s body, covered with wounds. Human. <br>&nbsp;<br>The mermaid stretched out next to him&#x2014;her pale, naked torso shifting to glittering scales as waist flared to hip, the curve of her tail like a perfectly fitted, exquisitely colored dress. A most wonderful silver, tinged with green. The mermaid sat up and pulled her tail to her side. She still didn&#x2019;t appear to be affected by the cold, despite the wind whipping all around her. Her skin seemed hard, like stone. As Margrethe realized this was the mermaid&#x2019;s <i>actual body, </i>a feeling of revulsion mixed with her wonder and awe. <i>What would it be like to be half a</i> <i>fish? </i>she thought. <i>How cold and hard was she to touch?</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The man was sputtering and coughing. The mermaid leaned over him, her breasts grazing his chest as she did. She kissed his forehead, stroked his wet hair. Even from a distance Margrethe could see the look of pure, radiant love that lit the mermaid&#x2019;s face as she gazed down on him.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>This is what rapture is, </i>Margrethe thought. That thing she saw come over the nuns&#x2019; faces as they knelt in prayer. She &#x2019;d tried turning to heaven, the way the women surrounding her did, but her heart, she knew, was too tied to the earth.<br>&nbsp;<br>Behind her the bells rang, announcing the late morning devotions. Suddenly the mermaid looked up and saw Margrethe. Margrethe gasped, caught. She could see the blue of the mermaid&#x2019;s eyes, as if the whole scene had become magnified, feel it inside her despite the distance between them. It was as if, for one moment, the mermaid was right there in the convent garden. <i>Save him, </i>the trees, the wind seemed to whisper. A voice inside<br>her. <i>You, come now.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>Margrethe stopped breathing, could barely feel her own body. And then, with one last look at the man, a last kiss on the lips, the creature pushed off from the rocks and dove back into the sea. Margrethe cried out and, without thinking, ran through the convent gate and down the stone steps&#x2014;hundreds of them&#x2014;that led to the beach. She hugged the furs to her body, almost slipping, reaching to the thin iron banister to steady herself, the air rushing and whirring around her, the stairs streaming under her endlessly.<br>&nbsp;<br>She arrived at the beach, stumbled over rocks, but there was no trace of the mermaid. Only him, the man the creature had pulled to shore. And there, by his hand, one gleaming oyster shell. Margrethe stood at the shoreline, then waded into the sea, not caring as water soaked through her boots. She stared out, but there was only endless ocean, cut up by rocks and ice and the worried, suffocating sky. Suddenly the world seemed entirely bleak and without hope. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Come back,&#x201d; Margrethe whispered. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d; But the sea was quiet now. The rocks pushed up from the water, motionless, like uncaring gods. The waves moved back and forth along the shoreline, slapping it, lunging to the earth, and then disappearing again.<br>&nbsp;<br>CHAPTER TWO<br><i>The Mermaid</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>The palace&#x2019;s great hall was unusually quiet that afternoon. The ocean floor, dense with sea plants and anemones and coral plates, was still, and the amber walls swayed only slightly, sprouting flowers that brushed the mermaid&#x2019;s skin as she swam past. The high- pointed amber windows had been flung open, and schools of glowing silver fish with pointed teeth poured through, illuminating the dark water. Above, thousands of mussel shells opened and closed with the currents. If she squinted, looked as hard as she could, she imagined she could make out the dim glare of the sun above.<br>&nbsp;<br>Her name was Lenia. She was the youngest daughter of the sea queen, and lived with her mother, father, grandmother, and five sisters in a large coral palace on the ocean floor. She made her way to the end of the great hall, where a piece of heavy, clouded glass hung over the grand fireplace. Both glass and fireplace had been recovered from sunken ships full of human bones and ephemera and treasures. Lenia found it strange to see her own image, and she usually avoided the glass and its tricks. But today she felt so different and changed, she had to see if it would be obvious to anyone else. <br>&nbsp;<br>Her sisters had badgered her all morning, their singing drifting through the water and every room of the palace, trying to lure her out to the garden, where they had all been waiting to hear her story. She had the most beautiful voice, everyone had always said, and it was she who&#x2019;d been most excited, of all the sisters, to swim to the upper world. She was the one who had the human statue in her garden, a garden as round and red as the sun. She was the one who&#x2019;d asked their grandmother countless times to tell her about men and women, about souls. <br>&nbsp;<br>But Lenia had waited in her room until she was quite sure her sisters had left for the day, until the only resident left in the palace was their old grandmother, who knew better than anyone that Lenia would talk when she was ready, and only then. Lenia came upon the clouded glass. It took her a minute to focus on her blue eyes, her white skin, the glittering moon hair that flew out on all sides of her in the water, her small, pink- tipped breasts, her long silver- gray tail, the oyster shells lining it, symbols of her high rank. Behind her, an octopus swayed this way and that, and a group of sea horses floated past.<br>&nbsp;<br>She leaned in until she was inches from her own reflection. She pressed her palms into her waist, her smooth, cold skin. She had thought she might look more . . . human, she realized. But she was the same as she &#x2019;d always been. She didn&#x2019;t even look older. Her face stared out at her from the glass, as if it were mocking her. There was nothing human about her. Her skin was opalescent, changing color ever so slightly as she shifted in the water. Her lips were stained pink with the sea flowers that had been ground for her. Water moved in and out of the tiny gills on her neck. And right below the curve of her belly, her skin took on a high sheen and then turned, slowly, to scale. Long, thin silver fish scales layered down her tail.<br>&nbsp;<br>She had wanted to go to the upper world for as long as she could remember. One by one her sisters had been allowed to travel to the surface of the water on their eighteenth birthdays, for the entire day, while she, the youngest, had to wait in the palace for their return. After each sister&#x2019;s visit, they&#x2019;d all gather in the gardens and hear tales of the curiosities and wonders that lay above. The fish would slip past their shoulders and faces as the lucky sister wove her tale, and Lenia would listen breathlessly as her sisters spoke of the glimmering cities and clattering carriages they&#x2019;d watched from the shore, the star- sprinkled night skies, the flying swans like long white veils over the sea, the mortal children with legs rather than tails, and the icebergs that glistened like pearls. <br>&nbsp;<br>Her sisters had been impressed by these things, but happy enough to return to the sea when their birthdays were over. But to Lenia, the whole upper world seemed so vast, so strange, so full, that she &#x2019;d been determined to venture farther than any of her sisters on her own eighteenth birthday, memorizing every moment of it. Once, mermaids had been able to visit the upper world whenever they wanted. They&#x2019;d appeared to sailors, bewitched travelers, stolen beautiful young men from seas...</p></p><h2>The Beautiful Badge: The Stories Behind the Football Club Badge</h2><p><i>The Beautiful Badge </i>is the first book to explore the history of football club badges.

In <i>Corpus Mysticum de Lubac</i> investigates a particular understanding of the relation of the church to the eucharist. He sets out the nature of the church as communion, a doctrine that influenced the thinking of the Second Vatican Council. With the publication of <i>Corpus Mysticum</i>, this important text of contemporary Catholic ecclesiology and sacramental theology is available for the first time in an English translation. Its publication fills a significant gap in the range of de Lubac's works available to English-speaking scholars. It will be an important resource in the widespread and ongoing ecumenical discussions among Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox theologians.</p><p>"One of the most significant theological developments of the 20th century was the return to an understanding of the Church based on the Eucharist. Though more modest in its original intention, <i>Corpus Mysticum</i> played a pioneering role in that return. Brimful of references to the fathers and medieval authors, it was here that de Lubac coined the phrase, 'the Eucharist makes the Church', that now is widely and readily used by many Christians. This fine, flowing translation, which will enable many more students and scholars to benefit from this remarkable resource, is greatly to be welcomed." --<b>Paul McPartlan, The Catholic University of America</b>His Eminence Henri Cardinal de Lubac, SJ (1896&#x2013;1991), a French Jesuit, is considered to be one of the most influential theologians of the twentieth century. He is the author of a number of books, including <i>Catholicism and Theology in History</i>.</p><h2>The Jewish Women of Ravensbr�ck Concentration Camp</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ravensbr�ck was the only major Nazi concentration camp for women. Located about fifty miles north of Berlin, the camp was the site of murder by slave labor, torture, starvation, shooting, lethal injection, "medical" experimentation, and gassing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While this camp was designed to hold 5,000 women, the actual figure was six times this number. Between 1939 and 1945, 132,000 women from twenty-three countries were imprisoned in Ravensbr�ck, including political prisoners, Jehovah's Witnesses, "asocials" (including Gypsies, prostitutes, and lesbians), criminals, and Jewish women (who made up about 20 percent of the population). Only 15,000 survived.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drawing upon more than sixty narratives and interviews of survivors in the United States, Israel, and Europe as well as unpublished testimonies, documents, and photographs from private archives, Rochelle Saidel provides a vivid collective and individual portrait of Ravensbr�ck&#x2019;s Jewish women prisoners. She worked for over twenty years to track down these women whose poignant testimonies deserve to be shared with a wider audience and future generations. Their memoirs provide new perspectives and information about satellite camps (there were about 70 slave labor sub-camps). Here is the story of real daily camp life with the women&#x2019;s thoughts about food, friendships, fear of rape and sexual abuse, hygiene issues, punishment, work, and resistance. Saidel includes accounts of the women's treatment, their daily struggles to survive, their hopes and fears, their friendships, their survival strategies, and the aftermath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 30, 1945, the Soviet Army liberated Ravensbr�ck. They found only 3,000 extremely ill women in the camp, because the Nazis had sent other remaining women on a death march. The <i>Jewish Women of Ravensbr�ck Concentration Camp</i> reclaims the lost voices of the victims and restores the personal accounts of the survivors.</p><p>Rochelle Saidel is founder and executive director of the Remember the Women Institute in New York and senior scientific researcher at the Center for the Study of Women and Gender at the University of S�o Paulo.

Ruthchild, <i>Women's Review of Books</i></p><br><br><p>"Thanks to Rochelle Saidel's sensitive interviews and meticulous research, together with the many previously unpublished photographs and haunting drawings by the inmates, this book will increase public recognition of Ravensbr�ck's victims and survivors. With this, <i>The Jewish Women of Ravensbr�ck Concentration Camp</i> takes its honorable place in the growing genre of gender study of the Holocaust."&#x2014;Eetta Prince-Gibson, <i>Jerusalem Post</i></p><br><br><p>"This is a welcome addition to the Holocaust literature. . . .

Are we missing a vital ingredient in its creation?<br><br> Like Richard Dawkins' <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, which provided a new perspective on evolution, <i>Life on the Edge </i>alters our understanding of life's dynamics as Jim Al-Khalili and Johnjoe Macfadden reveal the hitherto missing ingredient to be quantum mechanics. Drawing on recent ground-breaking experiments around the world, they show how photosynthesis relies on subatomic particles existing in many places at once, while inside enzymes, those workhorses of life that make every molecule within our cells, particles vanish from one point in space and instantly materialize in another. <br><br> Each chapter in<i> Life on the Edge </i>opens with an engaging example that illustrates one of life&#x2019;s puzzles &#x2013; How do migrating birds know where to go? How do we really smell the scent of a rose? How do our genes manage to copy themselves with such precision? &#x2013; and then reveals how quantum mechanics delivers its answer. Guiding the reader through the maze of rapidly unfolding discovery, Al-Khalili and McFadden communicate vividly the excitement of this explosive new field of quantum biology, with its potentially revolutionary applications, and also offer insights into the biggest puzzle of all: what is life?</p><p>Johnjoe McFadden is Professor of Molecular Genetics at the University of Surrey and is the editor of several leading text books. For over a decade, he has specialized in examining tuberculosis and meningitis, inventing the first successful molecular test for the latter.<b>Praise for <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller <i>Life on the Edge</i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>"Remarkable...<i>Life on the Edge</i>&nbsp;is a fascinating and thought-provoking book that combines solid science, reasonable extrapolation from the known into the unknown, and plausible speculation to give an accessible overview of a revolutionary transformation in our understanding of the living world."<br>&#x2014;<i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"The elemental provocation of the book lies in the authors' ability to make the complex conceivable...

For a decade between 1935 and 1946, Weegee made a name for himself snapping crime scenes, victims, and perpetrators. Armed with a Speed Graphic camera and a police-band radio, Weegee often beat the cops to the story, determined to sell his pictures to the sensation-hungry tabloids. His stark black-and-white photos were often lurid and unsettling. Yet, as this beautifully produced volume shows, they were also brimming with humanity. Designed as a series of &#x201c;dossiers,&#x201d; this book follows Weegee&#x2019;s transformation from a freelancer to a photo-detective.

He is also Australia&#39;s number one children&#39;s author! His books, including his popular Treehouse series, have been hugely successful internationally, winning awards and becoming bestsellers in the UK and the USA as well as in his homeland, Australia. The fourth Treehouse book, The 52-Storey Treehouse, won the Australian Book Industry Awards Book of the Year prize, the first children&#39;s book to ever do so. Andy thrives on having an audience: he has worked as a high-school teacher, been the lead singer in a rock band and a stand-up comedian. He is a passionate advocate for literacy, has two daughters and lives in Melbourne, Australia. Terry Denton is Andy&#39;s best mate. He is also a bestselling and award-winning writer and illustrator based in Melbourne, Australia. Among other things, he worked on the Horrible Science series for Scholastic UK. He lives by the beach with his wife and three kids.Gr 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Andy and Terry return and here share with listeners the story of how they came to live in their amazing 26-storey treehouse, which features an ice cream parlor that offers 78 flavors and an automatic tattoo machine. As Andy attempts to explain the backstory of their friendship, listeners are taken on a wild ride on the open seas with pirates, introduced to a shark that smells like moldy cheese, and forced to acknowledge the value of self-inflating underpants. Andy and Terry's neighbor, Jill, is a steadying influence, even while performing open shark surgery. The sound effects and accompanying classical music provide a dramatic and engaging backdrop to Stig Wemyss's remarkable narration. The voices of the protagonists as well as such supporting characters as Jill's wealthy parents as they party on their yacht as well as Captain Woodenhead's pirate dialect are delivered believably with humor and finesse. VERDICT Middle grade listeners will enjoy this rollicking tale.&#x2014;Terri Perper, Olney Elementary School, MD</p><h2>Terrors and Experts</h2><p><p>Iris Murdoch once suggested that to understand any philosopher's work we must ask what he or she is frightened of. To understand any psychoanalyst's work--both as a clinician and as a writer--we should ask what he or she loves, because psychoanalysis is about the unacceptable and about love, two things that we may prefer to keep apart, but that Freud found to be inextricable. If it is possible to talk about psychoanalysis as a scandal, without spuriously glamorizing it, then one way of doing it is simply to say that Freud discovered that love was compatible, though often furtively, with all that it was meant to exclude. There are, in other words--and most of literature is made up of these words--no experts on love. And love, whatever else it is, is terror.</p><p>In a manner characteristically engaging and challenging, charming and maddening, Adam Phillips teases out the complicity between desire and the forbidden, longing and dread. His book is a chronicle of that all-too-human terror, and of how expertise, in the form of psychoanalysis, addresses our fears--in essence, turns our terror into meaning.</p><p>It is terror, of course, that traditionally drives us into the arms of the experts. Phillips takes up those topics about which psychoanalysis claims expertise--childhood, sexuality, love, development, dreams, art, the unconscious, unhappiness--and explores what Freud's description of the unconscious does to the idea of expertise, in life and in psychoanalysis itself. If we are not, as Freud's ideas tell us, masters of our own houses, then what kind of claims can we make for ourselves? In what senses can we know what we are doing? These questions, so central to the human condition and to the state of psychoanalysis, resonate through this book as Phillips considers our notions of competence, of a professional self, of expertise in every realm of life from parenting to psychoanalysis. <i>Terrors and Experts</i> testifies to what makes psychoanalysis interesting, to that interest in psychoanalysis--which teaches us the meaning of our ignorance--that makes the terrors of life more bearable, even valuable.</p></p><p>What is psychoanalysis good for? The British essayist and psychotherapist Adam Phillips believes it's good for creating the sense that everyday life is worth approaching with wonder. In <i>Terrors and Experts</i>, Phillips redefines the terms in which many people discuss--and dismiss--psychoanalysis. He does this by examining it as a social practice, not a science, and criticizes analysts that believe that if they and their patients simply find things out, all their patients' problems will go away. Says Phillips, "When a doctor tries to solve every problem, rather than help his patient tolerate the terrifying uncertainties of introspection, he becomes an expert on human possibility, something no one could ever be, despite the posturing of our own favorite authorities."Adam Phillips is Principal Child Psychotherapist in the Wolverton Gardens Child and Family Consultation Centre, London.</p><h2>The Four Hundred Silent Years: (From Malachi to Matthew)</h2><p>It will be observed that my object has been, not merely to give a chronological outline of events, or a series of biographical sketches, but to trace throughout lessons and warnings for any who today, as those in the days of Nehemiah, have sought to return to and obey the word of God, in separation from the infidelity and apostasy of the times. Such are exposed to similar dangers&#x2014;though of a spiritual character&#x2014;as those which confronted the Jews. From their history we may therefore obtain valuable suggestions, and by carefully considering the causes of their failures, be preserved from falling into the same snares.</p><p>Henry (Harry) Allan Ironside was born in Canada in 1876.

In&nbsp;<i>The Last of the Light</i>, Peter Davidson takes readers through our culture&#x2019;s long engagement with the concept of twilight&#x2014;from the melancholy of smoky English autumn evenings to the midnight sun of northern European summers and beyond. Taking in poets and painters, Victorians and Romans, city and countryside, and deftly combining memoir, literature, philosophy, and art history, Davidson shows how the atmospheric shadows and the in-between nature of twilight has fired the imagination and generated works of incredible beauty, mystery, and romance. Ambitious and brilliantly executed, this is the perfect book for the bedside table, richly rewarding and endlessly thought-provoking.</p><p><b>Peter Davidson</b> is fellow of Campion Hall at the University of Oxford. He is the author of a book of essays about northern culture,&nbsp;<i>Distance and Memory</i>, and a collection of verse,&nbsp;<i>The Palace of Oblivion</i>.&#x201c;<i>The Last of the Light</i> is both a celebration of and inquiry into the significance of temperature and skies, especially at this time of year, when we are in the twilight of the seasons. . . . Davidson takes us to places that are vast and lovely as well as somehow underlit and shadowy, where a kind of emptiness and uncertainty prevails. . . . He loves the lost, the fading, the &#x2018;fugitive&#x2019; as Robert Macfarlane, in his <i>Landmarks</i>, quoted Davidson&#x2019;s word back to him. Here exactly is the tone and spirit of this book, ideas illuminated on the pages&#x2014;and in illustrations and colour plates&#x2014;which encourage our eyesight to become acute in the way it is at the end of the day, seeing everything so clearly before it falls back into shadow, for now &#x2018;one last hour, one hour more.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Kirsty Gunn <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Davidson&#x2019;s intricate meditation on twilight in European art and literature . . . is at once richly satisfying and as elusive as a ghost. . . . Like all good writers, he reveals the sheer strangeness of much that our eyes usually slide over.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Literary Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Davidson enters the twilight zone, tracing the crepuscular in science, psychology, history, and the arts. Considering the 60th parallel north, around which &#x2018;long evenings and protracted sunsets stretch,&#x2019; Davidson probes aspects of this transitional state, including visual perception during the stages of twilight (civil, nautical, and astronomical); dusk as a metaphor for crisis in Charles Dickens&#x2019;s Bleak House; the proliferation of gilt and mirrors in the murky pre-electric era; and the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins&#x2019; observations of anti-crepuscular rays.&#x201d; (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;And one wanted, since it&#x2019;s not dark yet: a history of twilight&#x2014;Peter Davidson&#x2019;s <i>The Last of the Light</i>.&#x201d; (Tim Dee <i>Guardian "Books of the Year"</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;For Christmas, I&#x2019;d like Peter Davidson&#x2019;s <i>The Last of the Light: About Twilight</i>.&#x201d; (Alexander McCall <i>Guardian "Books of the Year"</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This is simply one of the best books I have ever read.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (Clifford Cunningham <i>Sun News Miami</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;These days, you&#x2019;d expect an author just to google &#x2018;twilight&#x2019; and pile up everything he finds. Not Davidson; this is a deep and personal meditation, and while some references, particularly to painters, might be obvious&#x2014;Atkinson Grimshaw, Caspar David Friedrich, Whistler&#x2014;most are not. . . . Davidson ranges right across the disciplines in his search for allusions, citing Ruskin, Rilke, Chopin, Kant, and Vanbrugh along the way. The result is revealing, poetic, and (unavoidably) illuminating. As a bonus, the book is beautifully and copiously illustrated.&#x201d; (<i>Independent</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What a treasure trove this book is. . . .

Davidson is a discriminating and perceptive guide to the myriad ways in which twilight, in its various forms and at different seasons, &#x2018;silvers everything&#x2019;; and he evokes the &#x2018;other-worldliness&#x2019; of evening with a poet&#x2019;s sensitivity. . . . It<i></i>is an impressively ecumenical survey of the poetics and aesthetics of twilight, which canonizes hundreds of writers. . . . Peter Davidson&#x2019;s lyrical prose... dissolves the distinctions between memoir and criticism in a soft haze. His style is deliberately impressionistic.&#x201d; (Matthew Beaumont <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Davidson&#x2019;s twilight writing comes across as something of&nbsp;a barometer for time of day, for twilight. His acute eye, registering tiny gradations of light and tone, shares common ground with the contemporary English environmental observers . . . Richard Mabey, Robert Macfarlane, Tim Dee&#x2014;as well as with the ethos that informs Geoffrey Hill&#x2019;s poetry. Davidson&#x2019;s is a bravely unfashionable book, its cadences relentlessly slow. . . . Belatedness, as Davidson shows us, is the very essence of dusk, of the melancholy light of the fallen world.&#x201d;<br><br> &nbsp; (<i>Public Books</i>)</p><h2>Not by Sight</h2><p>Gripping Sophomore Novel from a Rising Historical Romance Talent<br><br>With Britain caught up in WWI, Jack Benningham, heir to the Earl of Stonebrooke, has declared himself a conscientious objector.

It is a troubling turn in the life of an idealistic glaciologist. Now in his early sixties, Zeno bewails the loss of his beloved glaciers, the disintegration of his marriage, and the foundering of his increasingly irrelevant career. Troubled in conscience and goaded by the smug complacency of the passengers in his charge, he starts to plan a desperate gesture that will send a wake-up call to an overheating world.<br><br><i>The Lamentations of Zeno</i> is an extraordinary evocation of the fragile and majestic wonders to be found at a far corner of the globe, written by a novelist who is a renowned travel writer. Poignant and playful, the novel recalls the experimentation of high-modernist fiction without compromising a limpid sense of place or the pace of its narrative. It is a portrait of a man in extremis, a haunting and at times irreverent tale that approaches the greatest challenge of our age&#x2014;perhaps of our entire history as a species&#x2014;from an impassioned human angle.</p><p><b>Ilija Trojanow</b> is a German novelist and travel writer, the author of many books of fiction and non-fiction, including <i>The Collector of Worlds</i>, <i>Along the Ganges</i>, and <i>Mumbai to Mecca</i>.

The author writes: <p>"During my travels all over the world, so many people have asked me, 'How can I find greater meaning in my life? Is there an answer to the emptiness, the unexpressed longing, I feel within my heart? Where is the love I am missing?'</p><p>"This, in essence, is what I tell them."</p></p><p>Sri Daya Mata, one of Paramahansa Yogananda's earliest and closest disciples, was the president of Self-Realization Fellowship/Yogoda Satsanga Society of India from 1955 until her passing in 2010. Born Faye Wright on January 31, 1914, in Salt Lake City, Utah, Daya Mata met Paramahansa Yogananda at the age of seventeen when she attended a lecture series he was giving in her hometown. Upon hearing him speak, she inwardly thought: "This man loves God as I have always longed to love Him. He knows God. Him I shall follow." Not long afterward, she entered his ashram in Los Angeles as a nun of the Self-Realization Order. During more than two decades of day-to-day association with Sri Yogananda, Daya Mata served as his confidential secretary; and over the years he entrusted her with increasing spiritual and administrative responsibilities. From the beginning he singled her out for a special role, and he encouraged other disciples to pattern their lives after her example. As Paramahansa Yogananda's spiritual successor, Sri Daya Mata guided his society for more than fifty years, faithfully carrying out his wishes and ideals for the dissemination of his teachings worldwide and for the establishment of Self-Realization Fellowship temples, centers, and retreats. She made several global speaking tours, including extended visits to India. Under her leadership, the pioneering spiritual work of Paramahansa Yogananda flourished, both in his native land and around the world. Two anthologies of her lectures and informal talks have been published, <i>Only Love: Living the Spiritual Life in a Changing World</i>, and <i>Finding the Joy Within You: Personal Counsel for God-Centered Living</i>. Many of her talks are also available on CD and DVD. A true mother of compassion as her name signifies, Sri Daya Mata inspired truth-seekers of all faiths and from all walks of life.</p><h2>Nineteen Seventy-Seven: The Red Riding Quartet, Book Two</h2><p>David Peace's acclaimed Red Riding Quartet continues with this exhilarating follow-up to <i>Nineteen Seventy-Four</i>. It's summer in Leeds and the city is anxiously awaiting the Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth's reign. Detective Bob Fraser and Jack Whitehead, a reporter at the <i>Post</i>, however, have other things on their minds-mainly the fact that someone is murdering prostitutes. The killer is quickly dubbed the &#x201c;Yorkshire Ripper&#x201d; and each man, on their own, works tirelessly to catch him. But their investigations turn grisly as they each engage in affairs with the prostitutes they are supposedly protecting. As the summer progresses, the killings accelerate and it seems as if Fraser and Whitehead are the only men who suspect or care that there may be more than one killer at large.</p><p>David Peace is the author of <b>The Red Riding Quartet</b>, <b>GB84</b>,<b>The Damned Utd</b> and <b>Tokyo Year Zero</b>.

Nothing but the bloody Jubilee in every paper till tomorrow morning, no-one remembering another Saturday night in Chapeltown.<br><br>Chapeltown - my town for two years; leafy streets filled with grand old houses carved into shabby little flats filled full of single women selling sex to fill their bastard kids, their bastard men, and their bastard habits.<br><br>Chapeltown - my deal: MURDER SQUAD.<br><br>The deals we make, the lies they buy, the secrets we keep, the silence they get.<br><br>I switch on the siren, a sledgehammer through all their Sunday mornings, a clarion call for the dead.<br><br>And Ellis says, 'That'll wake the fucking nig-nogs up.'<br><br>But a mile up ahead I know she'll not flinch upon her damp dew bed.<br><br>And Ellis smiles, like this is what it's all about; like this was what he'd signed up for all along.<br><br>But he doesn't know what's lying on the grass at Soldier's Field.<br><br>I do.<br><br>I know.<br><br>I've been here before.<br><br>And now, now it's happening again.<br><br>'Where the fuck's Maurice?'<br><br>I'm walking towards her, across the grass, across Soldier's Field. I say, 'He'll be here.'<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent Peter Noble, George's boy, out from behind his fat new Millgarth desk, between me and her.<br><br>I know what he's hiding: there'll be a raincoat over her, boots or shoes placed on her thighs, a pair of panties left on one leg, a bra pushed up, her stomach and breasts hollowed out with a screwdriver, her skull caved in with a hammer.<br><br>Noble looks at his watch and says, 'Well, anyroad, I'm taking this one.'<br><br>There's a bloke in a tracksuit by a tall oak, throwing up. I look at my watch. It's seven and there's a fine steam coming off the grass all across the park.<br><br>Eventually I say, 'It him?'<br><br>Noble moves out of the way. 'See for yourself.'<br><br>'Fuck,' says Ellis.<br><br>The man in the tracksuit looks up, spittle all down him, and I think about my son and my stomach knots.<br><br>Back on the road, more cars are arriving, people gathering.<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent Noble says, 'The fuck you put that sodding siren on for? World and his wife'll be out here now.'<br><br>'Possible witnesses,' I smile and finally look at her:<br><br>There's a tan raincoat draped over her, white feet and hands protruding. There are dark stains on the coat.<br><br>'Have a bloody look,' Noble says to Ellis.<br><br>'Go on,' I add.<br><br>Detective Constable Ellis slowly puts on two white plastic gloves and then squats down on the grass beside her.<br><br>He lifts up the coat, swallows and looks up at me. 'It's him,' he says.<br><br>I just stand there, nodding, looking off at some crocuses or something.<br><br>Ellis lowers the coat.<br><br>Noble says, 'He found her.'<br><br>I look back over at the man in the tracksuit, at the man with the sick on him, grateful. 'Got a statement?'<br><br>'If it's not too much trouble,' smiles Noble.<br><br>Ellis stands up. 'What a fucking way to go,' he says.<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent Noble lights up and exhales. 'Silly slag,' he hisses.<br><br>'I'm Detective Sergeant Fraser and this is Detective Constable Ellis. We'd like to take a statement and then you can get off home.'<br><br>'Statement.' He pales again. 'You don't think I had anything . . .'<br><br>'No, sir. Just a statement detailing how you came to be here and report this.'<br><br>'I see.'<br><br>'Let's sit in the car.'<br><br>We walk over to the road and get in the back. Ellis sits in the front and switches off the radio.<br><br>It's hotter than I thought it would be. I take out my notebook and pen. He reeks. The car was a bad idea.<br><br>'Let's start with your name and address.'<br><br>'Derek Poole, with an e. 4 Strickland Avenue, Shadwell.'<br><br>Ellis turns round. 'Off Wetherby Road?'<br><br>Mr Poole says, 'Yes.'<br><br>'That's quite a jog,' I say.<br><br>'No, no. I drove here. I just jog round the park.'<br><br>'Every day?'<br><br>'No. Just Sundays.'<br><br>'What time did you get here?'<br><br>He pauses and then says, 'About sixish.'<br><br>'Where'd you park?'<br><br>'About a hundred yards up there,' he says, nodding up the Roundhay Road.<br><br>He's got secrets has Derek Poole and I'm laying odds with myself:<br><br>2-1 affair.<br><br>3-1 prostitutes.<br><br>4-1 puff.<br><br>Sex, whatever.<br><br>He's a lonely man is Derek Poole, often bored. But this isn't what he had in mind for today.<br><br>He's looking at me. Ellis turns round again.<br><br>I ask, 'Are you married?'<br><br>'Yes, I am,' he replies, like he's lying.<br><br>I write down married.<br><br>He says, 'Why?'<br><br>'What do you mean, why?'<br><br>He shifts in his tracksuit. 'I mean, why do you ask?'<br><br>'Same reason I'm going to ask how old you are.'<br><br>'I see. Just routine?'<br><br>I don't like Derek Poole, his infidelities and his arrogance, so I say, 'Mr Poole, there's nothing routine about a young woman having her stomach slashed open and her skull smashed in.'<br><br>Derek Poole looks at the floor of the car. He's got sick on his trainers and I'm worried he'll puke again and we'll have the stink for a week.<br><br>'Let's just get this over with,' I mutter, knowing I've gone too far.<br><br>DC Ellis opens the door for Mr Poole and we're all back out in the sun.<br><br>There are so many fucking coppers now, and I'm looking at them thinking, too many chiefs:<br><br>There's my gaffer Detective Inspector Rudkin, Detective Superintendent Prentice, DS Alderman, the old head of Leeds CID Detective Chief Superintendent Maurice Jobson, the new head Noble and, in the centre of the scrum, the man himself: Assistant Chief Constable George Oldman.<br><br>Over by the body Professor Farley, the Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine at Leeds University, and his assistants are preparing to take her away from all this.<br><br>Detective Superintendent Alderman has a handbag in his hands, he's taking a WPC and a uniform off with him.<br><br>They've got a name, an address.<br><br>Prentice is marshalling the uniforms, going door to door, corralling the gawpers.<br><br>The cabal turns our way.<br><br>Detective Inspector Rudkin, as hungover as fuck, shouts, 'Murder Room, thirty minutes.'<br><br>The Murder Room.<br><br>Millgarth Street, Leeds.<br><br>One hundred men stuffed into the second-floor room. No windows, only smoke, white lights, and the faces of the dead.<br><br>In comes George and the rest of his boys, back from the park. There are pats on the back, handshakes here, winks there, like some fucking reunion.<br><br>I stare across the desks and the phones, the sweating shirt backs and the stains, at the walls behind the Assistant Chief Constable, at the two faces I've seen so many, many times, every day, every night, when I wake, when I dream, when I fuck my wife, when I kiss my son:<br><br>Theresa Campbell.<br><br>Joan Richards.<br><br>Familiarity breeds contempt.<br><br>Noble speaks:<br><br>'Gentlemen, he's back.'<br><br>The dramatic pause, the knowing smiles.<br><br>'The following memorandum has been sent to all Divisions and surrounding areas:<br><br>'At 0650 this morning, the body of Mrs Marie Watts born 7.2.45, of 3 Francis Street, Leeds 7, was found on Soldier's Field, Roundhay, near West Avenue, Leeds 8. The body was found to have extensive head injuries, a cut throat, and stab wounds to the abdomen.<br><br>'This woman had been living in the Leeds area since October 1976, when she came up from London. It is believed she worked in hotels in London. She was reported missing by her husband from Blackpool in November 1975.<br><br>'Enquiries are requested of all persons coming into police custody for bloodstains on their clothing and also enquiries at dry cleaners for any clothing with blood on it. Any replies to Murder Room, Millgarth Street Police Station.<br><br>'Message ends.'<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent Noble stands there with his piece of paper, waiting.<br><br>'Add to that,' he continues. 'Boyfriend, one Stephen Barton, 28, black, also of 3 Francis Street. Some form for burglary, GBH. Probably pimped the late Mrs Watts. Works the door at the International over in Bradford, sometimes Cosmos. Didn't show up at either place yesterday and hasn't been seen since about six o'clock last night when he left the Corals on Skinner Lane, where he'd just chucked away best part of fifty quid.'<br><br>The room's impressed. We've got a name, a history, and it's not yet two hours.<br><br>A chance at last.<br><br>Noble lowers his eyes, his tongue on the edge of his lips. Quietly he says, 'You lot, find him.'<br><br>The blood of one hundred men pumping hard and fast, hounds the lot of us, the stink of the hunt like bloody marks upon our brows.<br><br>Oldman stands up:<br><br>'It's going to break down like this:<br><br>'As you all know, this is number 3 at best. Then there's the other possible attacks. You've all worked one or more of them so, as of today, you're all now officially Prostitute Murder Squad, out of this Station, under Detective Chief Superintendent Noble here.'<br><br>PROSTITUTE MURDER SQUAD.<br><br>The room is humming, buzzing, singing: everyone getting what they wanted.<br><br>Me too -<br><br>Off post office robberies and Help the fucking Aged:<br><br>Sub-postmasters at gun-point, six-barrels in their faces, wives tied up with a smack and a punch in their nighties, only Scrooge won't give it up, so it's a cosh from the butt of the shotgun and welcome to heart attack city.<br><br>One dead.<br><br>'Murder Squad'll break down into four teams, headed up by Detective Superintendents Prentice and Alderman and Detective Inspectors Rudkin and Craven. DI Craven will also co-ordinate Admin from here at Millgarth. Communications will be DS White, the Divisional Officer will be Detective Inspector Gaskins, and Community Affairs and Press will be DI Evans, all based in Wakefield.'<br><br>Oldman pauses. I scan the room for Craven, but he's nowhere.<br><br>'Myself and Detective Chief Superintendent Jobson will also be making ourselves available to the investigation.'<br><br>I swear there are sighs.<br><br>Oldman turns round and says, 'Pete?'<br><br>Detective Chief Superintendent Noble steps forward again:<br><br>'I want every wog under thirty who's not married leant on. I want names. Some smartarse said our man hates women - hold the fucking front page.'<br><br>Laughter.<br><br>'All right, so let's have every fucking puff in your book in here too. Same goes for the usuals - shags and their lads. I want names and I want them names in here by five. SPG'll round them up. Ladies can go to Queens, rest here.'<br><br>Silence.<br><br>'And I want Stephen Barton. Tonight.'<br><br>I'm biting my nails. I want out of here.<br><br>'So phone home, tell them you'll be out all night. BECAUSE THIS ENDS HERE TONIGHT.'<br><br>One thought - JANICE.<br><br>Through the melee and out the door and down the corridor, Ellis trapped back down the hall, calling my name.<br><br>Outside the canteen there's no answer and I slam down the phone just as Ellis catches up.<br><br>'Fuck you going off to?'<br><br>'Come on, we got to get started,' and I'm off again, down the stairs and out the door.<br><br>'I want to drive,' he whines behind.<br><br>'Fuck off.'<br><br>I've got my foot down, flying through the centre back to Chapeltown, police radio still crackling with the New Fire.<br><br>Ellis is rubbing his hands together, saying, 'See he has his good points; big-time overtime.'<br><br>'Unless they vote to continue ban,' I mutter, thinking I've got to lose him.<br><br>'More for them that wants it.'<br><br>I say, 'When we get there, we should split up.'<br><br>'Get where?'<br><br>'Spencer Place,' I say, like he's as dumb as he looks.<br><br>'Why?'<br><br>I want to throw on the fucking brakes and punch him but, instead, I smile and say, 'Try and nip some of the usual bullshit in the bud. Stop them all yapping.'<br><br>I turn right, back on to Roundhay Road.<br><br>'You're boss,' he says, like it's only a matter of fucking time.<br><br>'Yeah,' I say and keep my foot down.<br><br>'You take the right-hand side. Start with Yvonne and Jean in 5.'<br><br>We've parked up round the corner on Leopold Street.<br><br>'Fuck. I have to?'<br><br>'You heard Noble. Names, he wants fucking names.'<br><br>'What about you?'<br><br>'I'll do Janice and Denise in 2.'<br><br>'Bet you will.' He's looking at me sideways.<br><br>I let it go with a wink.<br><br>He reaches for the door. 'Then what?'<br><br>'Keep going. Meet you back here when you're done.'<br><br>He tuts and scratches his knackers as he gets out the car, his mind made up.<br><br>I think my heart's going to fucking burst.<br><br>I wait until Ellis is inside number 5, then I open the door and walk up the stairs.<br><br>The house is quiet and stinks of smoke and dope.<br><br>I tap on her door at the top of the stairs.<br><br>She comes to the door looking like a Red Indian, her dark hair and skin covered in a film of sweat, like she's just been fucking and fucking for real.<br><br>The nights I've dreamt about her.<br><br>'You can't come in. I'm working.'<br><br>'There's been another.'<br><br>'So?'<br><br>'You can't stay round here.'<br><br>'So how about your place?'<br><br>'Please,' I whisper.<br><br>'You going to make an honest woman of me, are you Mr Policeman?'<br><br>'I'm serious.'<br><br>'So am I. I need money.'<br><br>I pull out notes, screwing them up in her face.<br><br>'Yeah?'<br><br>'Yeah,' I nod.<br><br>'What about a ring, Prince Bobby?'<br><br>I sigh and start to speak.<br><br>'One like you gave your wife.'<br><br>I look at the carpet, the stupid flowers and birds woven together under my feet.<br><br>I look up and Janice slaps me once.<br><br>'Piss off, Bob.'<br><br>'Fucking give him up!'<br><br>'Piss off!'<br><br>Ellis pushes her head back, banging it against the wall.<br><br>'Fuck off!'<br><br>'Come on, Karen,' I say. 'Just tell us where he is and we're away.'<br><br>'I don't fucking know.' She's crying and I believe her.<br><br>We've been at this now for over six hours and DC Michael Ellis wouldn't know the fucking truth if it walked up and smacked him in the gob, so he walks up to Karen Burns, white, twenty-three, convicted prostitute, drug addict, mother of two, and smacks her in the gob instead.<br><br>'Easy Mike, easy,' I hiss.<br><br>She falls away against her wallpaper, sobbing and angry.<br><br>Ellis tugs at his balls.

In <i>Spiritual Theology</i> Allen turns to the great teachers of the past&#x2015;the church fathers, Augustine, Maximus the Confessor, Bonaventure, Hugh of St. Victor, Calvin and Luther, George Herbert&#x2015;to recover a spirituality that is rich with the doctrines and disciplines of theology.<br><br>Allen covers the great questions of the spiritual life: what is the Christian goal? what leads us toward that goal, and what hinders us? what is conversion? how can we discern our progress in the spiritual life? what are the fruits of the Spirit?<br><br>A second purpose of the book is to introduce readers to the disciplines and texts of the threefold way, found in the eastern church from the fourth century on. Allen writes simply and clearly of the active life and the development of virtue, and the contemplative life, which includes coming to know God through the Book of Nature and the Book of Scripture as well as directly, face to face, which is the domain of mystical theology.<br><br>This book is a basic and accessible introduction to the classic writings and doctrines of the spiritual life.</p><p><b>DIOGENES ALLEN</b> is Stuart Professor of Philosophy at Princeton Theological Seminary. He teaches widely in both Presbyterian and Anglican churches, and is the author of a number of books on the spiritual life.Diogenes Allen's new book . . . begins with an autobiographical exploration as to his discovery of &#x2018;spiritual theology' after years of being &#x2018;a teacher of philosophy and theology to students preparing to be ministers.'&#x201c;This introduction is helpful and sets the scene for Allen's endeavour, which is to open up the depths and vistas of the Great Tradition as a practice of holy living&#x2015;a bodily practice of learning &#x2018;to live every moment of one's life with an awareness of God.' Allen writes fluently, and in eleven shortish chapters covers the classical pattern of the spiritual journey as it has been repeatedly performed in the tradition. Above all his work bears the very real enthusiasm of a &#x2018;convert' who you sense is discovering something for the first time and is exceptionally eager to pass it on. (David Moss, St. Stephen&#x2019;s House <i>New Directions</i>)<br><br>C. S. Lewis once wrote of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i> that &#x2018;it is not addressed to our condition.' It suggests, for example, that scholars and writers hide themselves in the study when they should be helping in the kitchen. . . . The main thrust of this book is addressed directly to our condition. It is concerned with how we may live in the presence of God, and grow in the spiritual life. . . .&#x201c;The author draws on the whole sweep of theology and spirituality throughout the ages, and makes substantial connections between, for example, Calvin's Institutes and the life of prayer, Gregory of Nyssa and the goal of Christian spirituality, and Iris Murdoch and moral awareness.&#x201c;The book is accessible in the best sense, not patronizing or simplistic, but clear, well illustrated, and free from theological jargon. It is a good and useful book which will take a thoughtful reader into the rich tradition of theological spirituality. (Philip Crowe <i>Theology</i>)<br><br>I was glad to see the first chapter of this book entitled &#x2018;What is Spiritual Theology?' as that was the first question that came to my mind when I wondered whether or not to read it, given that I do not like theology and have never heard of the spiritual variety. . . . In a way, Diogenes Allen's opening is an easy one, clearly and kindly written, citing examples from all ages and branches of Christian history. . . . &#x201c;Allen examines the most common reasons why people seek God, starting with distress in the face of troubles such as natural disasters. He writes well. All the motives he mentions for God-seeking are well explained, with the help of extracts from his customary wealth of sources. ...&#x201c;Perhaps it is because I am a Catholic that I settled down most comfortably when I was past conversion and on to the eight deadly thoughts (or seven deadly sins, as they were called when I first learnt about them). Allen's account of the difference between lust and sexual instinct is just one of those in this chapter which I thought a masterpiece. His piece on the dark night of the soul is wonderful. . . . &#x201c;By the time I had finished his chapters on &#x2018;The Book of Scripture' and &#x2018;The Book of Nature,' I was feeling positively inspired. It was a bit of a relief to find the end of the book discussing the growing closeness of God in terms of a habitual presence for spiritual theologians rather than a moment of ecstasy. . . . &#x201c;The book . . . is only 161 paperback pages of text, of which the central matter-of-fact core of advice will be good to have at hand while fighting one's way through life.

Renowned naturalist, writer, and filmmaker David Attenborough treks across every continent and kind of terrain to introduce us to such unusual and evolutionarily successful creatures as the Patagonian opossum, the Canadian pygmy shrew, the Alpine marmot, and the Malaysian sun bear. We meet slow-moving algae-covered sloths. We enter a pack of African wild dogs, seeing how their division of labor enables them to provide protection and food to pups, mothers, and old dogs. We learn about the navigation systems of bats and find out why Borneo's colugo is a superior glider to a flying squirrel. Along the way, Attenborough considers how evolution has shaped mammalian habits, leading herbivorous sea cows to take to the water and humans to commence agriculture.</p><br><p> Containing more than 200 spectacular color photographs, this is a book that will gratify anyone intrigued by the natural world and the animals that inhabit it. Informative, utterly absorbing, and classic Attenborough, it represents natural history at its finest.</p></p><p><b>David Attenborough</b> was born in 1926 and educated at Cambridge. He started making television documentaries in the 1950s, produced the series <i>Zoo Quest</i>, and made some of television's first black-and-white nature films before being promoted to senior management at the BBC. In the 1970s, Attenborough returned to filmmaking and has subsequently produced some of the most famous wildlife documentaries ever made, most notably his <i>Life</i> series. He was knighted in 1985 and now lives near London. He is the author of <i>The Life of Birds</i>, <i>The Private Life of Plants</i>, and <i>Life on Air</i> (all Princeton).The veteran natural history author and filmmaker (<i>The Private Life of Plants</i>, <i>The Life of Birds</i>) now turns his attention to the order of mammals. Published to coincide with a television series to air on the Discovery Channel, the book's 10 chapters mirror the series' 10 episodes. The most diverse of the vertebrates, mammals include the largest animals on earth (blue whales), animals that fly (bats), and animals that can eat almost any type of food. The author makes sense of this diversity by dividing mammals into easily understandable groups and explaining how evolution has shaped the lives of each of these groups of mammals. Attenborough discusses what makes a mammal a mammal, then goes on to discuss the varying lifestyles of mammalian species. Heavily illustrated with beautiful photographs and enlivened by Attenborough's friendly, informative writing style, this is a terrific introduction to the wonders of our hairy, milk-producing relatives. <i>Nancy Bent</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After receiving them in the White House, Reagan spoke to the press, referring to his foreign guests as &#34;freedom fighters.&#34; These were the Afghan mujahideen. In August 1998, another American president ordered missile strikes from the American navy based in the Indian Ocean to kill Osama bin Laden and his men in the camps in Afghanistan. The terrorist of yesterday is the hero of today, and the hero of yesterday becomes the terrorist of today. In Terrorism: Theirs and Ours, Eqbal Ahmad holds up the concepts of &#34;terrorist&#34; and &#34;freedom fighter&#34; to U.S. foreign policy. What do these terms mean? Where do they apply? How can the roots of political violence be stemmed? An invaluable primer.</p><p>EQBAL AHMAD, who passed away in 1999, was hailed by his close friend Edward Said as &#34;perhaps the shrewdest and most original anti-imperialist analyst of the postwar world, particularly of the dynamics between the West and postcolonial Asia and Africa; a man of enormous charisma, dazzling eloquence, incorruptible ideals, unfailing generosity and sympathy. Humanity and genuine secularism ... had no finer champion.&#34; Eqbal Ahmad was Professor Emeritus of International Relations and Middle Eastern Studies at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts.

We may be tempted to look for a sure-fire formula, but the reality is quite different: effective leaders are exceptional generalists rather than narrow specialists. The best leaders take what the best business experts have to offer, and apply that based on their own abilities, experience and judgment. And these leaders seek real-life mentors and learn from them. Gayle Beebe, who has spent over a decade as a college president, had the opportunity to study with Peter Drucker, the father of modern management and the author of <em>The Effective Executive.</em> Drawing on Drucker's influence as well as his own years of experiences as a pastor, administrator and president, Beebe has developed a pyramid of leadership principles. The combination of these defines a leader of influence and integrity. In these pages you'll also meet some of Beebe's other mentors: Steve Sample of USC, Harold A. "Red" Poling of Ford Motor Company, Richard Foster of Renovar�, David McKenna of Asbury Seminary and Bob Emmons of SmartFinal. In a day of relentless self-direction, strong leaders have a critical role. With this book you can discover what it takes to be effective in your sphere of influence.</p><p><strong>Gayle D. Beebe</strong> earned a Ph.D. in the philosophy of religion and an M.B.A. in strategic management from Claremont Graduate University. He is president of Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California, and past president of Spring Arbor University in Spring Arbor, Michigan. He coauthored <em>Longing for God</em> with Richard Foster."I believe the principles contained in this book will have a cumulative effect. Here is a leader who wants to wrestle with self-development while keeping it realistic to individual circumstances. Do you have a longing to be a leader? Do you have a desire to make a difference? If so, you will enjoy this book immensely. It will provide the motivation you need, daily, to improve and make progress on your leadership skills and character." (Albert Huizing IV, Haddington House Journal, 2014)<br><br>"<em>The Shaping of an Effective Leader</em> by Dr. Gayle Beebe, president of Westmont College, offers a refreshing perspective of leadership that can be applied to not-for-profits, business or ministry. I have been inspired by the clarity of purpose of his leadership fundamentals." (WHOA Magazine for Women, Winter 2014)<br><br>"<em>The Shaping of an Effective Leader</em> is likely to generate some excitement in leadership circles. Recommend it especially to pastors and church administrators, business owners and community leaders, and seminary students and business majors." (Daniel Johnson, CBA Retailers + Resources, January 2012)<br><br>"Every person who serves in leadership or aspires to needs to read this book. . . . This book instructs without being pedantic, inspires without being clich�d and challenges without being arrogant. It reminds us that leadership is not only an art; it is a practice to be nurtured, cultivated and honed over a lifetime. Because the book frames the leadership experience in such helpful and formative ways, someone aspiring for insight born of experience and rigorous thinking will find a reservoir of valuable wisdom." (Dr. Steve Moore, executive director and CEO, The M. J. Murdock Trust)<br><br>"This book is for all individuals, organizations, schools and businesses, profit and nonprofit. During this time when leadership in political and industrial arenas has deteriorated, Beebe's book shows and develops the importance of maintaining clear convictions as we lead. The 'pyramid' of conditions for developing strong leadership makes it easy to discern where and how one is starting and where one is going." (Leslie Ridley-Tree, president and CEO, Pacific Air Industries)<br><br>"This is not just another book on leadership. It is written by an effective leader who has achieved meaningful results in the organizations he has led. He shares with us lessons and principles he has learned from the mentoring relationships he had with Peter Drucker and other important thought leaders. It was Drucker who reminded us that a leader has only one choice to make--to lead or mislead. Gayle Beebe has chosen to lead. Read and learn from his wisdom and experience." (C. William Pollard, chairman emeritus, ServiceMaster)<br><br>"This marvelous book on leadership is a product of Dr. Beebe's creative thinking and research, as well as his effective use of leadership concepts from other professional thinkers. The bottom line is this book is filled with challenging new ideas presented with great clarity. Whether you are just beginning your career, are a professional coaching top executives or have already achieved a significant leadership position, you will benefit from reading this insightful book. . . . Those willing to look critically into the mirror of this book will unquestionably become more effective leaders." (William T. Esrey, retired chair and CEO, Sprint)<br><br>"I am so thankful for Gayle Beebe. I am confident that you will share my gratitude for him when you have completed reading <em>The Shaping of an Effective Leader.</em> In this wise, practical and insightful book, Beebe serves as a trustworthy guide for helping us understand the meaning and expectations of leadership. Readers will gain a greater appreciation for the work of leaders and leadership teams, as well as the key aspects of effective organizations. I learned much from this book and heartily commend it to others." (David S. Dockery, president, Union University)<br><br>"Keep your highlighter handy! This book is brilliant--rich in wisdom, inviting in style and logical in structure. It is immensely, practically and immediately helpful. I'll admit my biases: great admiration for Gayle Beebe, huge respect for Peter Drucker and a warm friendship with the publisher, InterVarsity Press. Of any recent book on leadership, and there are many, I want this one close at hand." (John D. Beckett, chairman, The Beckett Companies, and author of Loving Monday and Mastering Monday)<br><br>"Gayle Beebe's book is valuable precisely because it discusses how effective and moral leaders develop. . . . [He] wonderfully applies the insights of Peter Drucker, his former professor and the father of modern management theories." (From the foreword by Steve Forbes)</p><h2>Images of Soul: Reimagining Astrology</h2><p>Out of a friendship and collegial conversation spanning three decades, Hadley Fitzgerald and Judith Harte have created a provocative fusion of astrological symbolism, Depth Psychotherapy, and Imaginal Psychology. Their discourse interfaces with the &#x201c;acorn theory&#x201d; of the late archetypal psychologist James Hillman who conjectured that each life has its own soul's code, its own calling. The authors see this as resonant with a natural, yet sophisticated astrology wherein the horoscope's trajectory is viewed as a pathway to one's personal archetypal ground. They suggest that we can evolve in the direction of our own life's calling by viewing the horoscope as analogous to an acorn, inside of which is one&#x2019;s unique soul's code with a mysterious timepiece all its own. As licensed psychotherapists who are actively engaged in the arts, they often use images, imaginal dialogue, and evolutionary astrological methods to deepen their clients&#x2019; psychotherapeutic processes.</p><p>This dialogue between Hadley Fitzgerald and Judith Harte draws us into a valuable fresh imagination of the very nature of astrology. It's beautiful and fun. I hope it moves astrology itself into a new era, focusing on images that have the power to shape our lives and enrich our understanding of them.<br>&nbsp;-- Thomas Moore, author of The Care of the Soul, The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life <br><br>What a feast for mind and soul! Two women, each one of them a master astrologer and an experienced psychotherapist, toss both crafts into the alchemical pot of their shared creative imagination. In pushing the boundaries of both systems, they reveal a path into a wider, saner, and more integrated future. <br>-- Steven Forrest, author of The Inner Sky, Yesterday's Sky <br><br>In the form of their intimate and loving correspondence, the authors beautifully illustrate the ways in which the astrological birth chart reveals the spiritual ground plan for the soul's evolution. The authors' focus on images of this sacred pattern deepens and personalizes this approach to astrology. I particularly recommend this text to readers who value a depth psychological approach to astrology. <br>-- Lionel Corbett, M.D., Jungian Analyst, author of The Sacred Cauldron, Psyche and the Sacred<br><br>An occasion for the reader to dip a toe into the sacred pond of Imagination, Images of Soul is an intimate conversational portrait disclosing the living waters of Psyche. It revivifies and deepens the trivialized remains of a once vibrant and animated wisdom tradition bringing it new life. <br>-- Brad Kochunas, author of The Astrological Imagination <br><br>Judith and Hadley have created something very special and unique in exploring the resonant space between depth psychotherapy and astrology. I love the book! <br>-- Brockton Hill, JD, MFT, Jungian Analyst/Archetypal Astrologer <br><br>I found Images of Soul to be a creative, original, and inspiring example for clinicians like myself who see it as part of our life's work to merge the astrological and psychological perspectives in a clinical setting. The images of soul explored throughout this book forge a creative pathway toward the deeper fusion of psychotherapy and astrology&#x2014;the two companionable modes of perceiving psyche. <br>-- Gisele Terry, MFT, President, International Society for Astrological Research<p>Hadley Fitzgerald, MA, MFT, has been a licensed psychotherapist almost as long as she&#x2019;s been an astrologer. She had visions of becoming a Shakespearean scholar, but her soul had other plans. She has a BA in English from UCLA, and after a 1974 epiphany in which she envisioned astrology as an integral part of psychology and psychotherapy in the future, she received her MA from Phillips Graduate Institute in 1979 and her Marriage and Family Therapy license in 1981. She authored the Psychological Astrology section of "Under One Sky" by Rafael Nasser and is a free-lance writer. She has a certificate in Ecopsychology from the Institute for Cultural Change and is also a Certified Tarotpy� Practitioner. While traditional therapeutic methods are her foundation, Hadley often expands on those methods by using astrology&#x2019;s ancient archetypal symbols to help clients address the conundrums of individual and family dynamics on another level. When appropriate, she brings in a wide variety of tarot and other images to explore the mythic dimensions of each life alongside the daily emotional issues, choices, and opportunities for expression that can aid the evolution of the soul as it travels through this lifetime. At the heart of her training and her work is this question: &#x201c;What does your soul--your daimon--want of you, want with you?&#x201d;</p><p> </p><p>To learn more, visit: www.HadleyFitzgerald.com</p><p> </p><p>Judith Harte, PhD, MFT, has been an archetypal astrologer since 1975 and a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist since 1985.

The book makes references to spiritual traditions and woman mystics that have viewed the divine feminine as a great creative force in the universe.

Knights, monks, apprentices, guildsmen all underwent a process of initiation into their unique subcultures. As <i>From Boys to Men</i> shows, the process of this socialization reveals a great deal about medieval ideas of what it meant to be a man&#x2014;as distinguished from a boy, from a woman, and even from a beast.</p><p>In an exploration of the creation of adult masculine identities in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, <i>From Boys to Men</i> takes a close look at the roles of men through the lens of three distinct institutions: the university, the aristocratic household and court, and the craft workshop. Ruth Mazo Karras demonstrates that, while men in the later Middle Ages were defined as the opposite of women, this was never the only factor in determining their role in society. A knight proved himself against other men by the successful use of violence as well as by successful control of women. University scholars proved themselves against each other through a violence that was metaphorical and against other men by their Latinity and their use of the tools of logic and rationality. Craft workers proved their manhood by achieving independent householder status.</p><p>Drawing on sources throughout Northern Europe, including court records and other administrative documents, prescriptive texts such as instructions for dubbing to knighthood, biographies, and imaginative literature, <i>From Boys to Men</i> sheds new light on how young men were trained to take their place in medieval society and the implications of that training for the construction of gender in the Middle Ages. </p><p>Rescuing maleness from its classification as an ungendered category, <i>From Boys to Men</i> unravels what it meant to be men in a womanless context, revealing the common threads that emerge from the study of young manhood in various disparate institutional settings.</p></p><p>Ruth Mazo Karras is Professor of History at the University of Minnesota.<p>"The book, well written and accessible, will find a broad audience. It would work well in the classroom, either as a source of lecture material or as assigned reading. Effectively combating the nonspecialist's view of the Middle Ages as a monolithic and static society, it will encourage more subtle thinking about gender identities in the past and in the present. The book also sets a research agenda for specialists.&#x2014;<i>American Historical Review</i></p><br><br><p>"Extremely welcome."&#x2014;<i>History</i></p><br><br><p>"Part of the achievement of this fine book is the care with witch it unfolds material and textual evidence of male and female relations. No less valuable is its subtle acknowledgment that modern preoccupations with gender and sexuality can prompt overreading of sources."&#x2014;<i>Journal of English and Germanic Philology</i></p><br><br><p>"A founding document in the field of men's history."&#x2014;Jo Ann McNamara, author of <i>Sisters in Arms</i></p></p><h2>Grace...the Power to Reign: The Light Shining from Romans 5-8</h2><p>We struggle against sin and yearn for God's highest. Yet, on a bad day it is as if we are fighting with gravity. Questions go unanswered: <p>* Where is the power to overcome temptations and trials? </p><p>* Is God really willing to breathe into us so that these dry bones can live and we may stand strong? </p><p>For anyone who ever has clenched his fist and ground his teeth in the struggle to live godly, here are the answers. Just as there is a force in the world pushing us to sin there is a greater force flowing from God which can lift us, transform us, and make us what He wants us to be. It is grace! It is grace which few have grasped, yet so many have sought desperately. Now we can find it.</p></p><p>Harold R.

She was also, as Tracy Borman&#39;s wonderfully readable biography reveals, a dedicated patron of the arts; a lively and talented intellectual in her own right; a victim of adultery; a passionate advocate for the rights of women long before the dawn of feminism. Above all she was a woman of reason in an Age of Reason. The mark that this enigmatic and largely neglected royal mistress left on the society and culture of early Georgian England was to resonate well beyond the confines of the court, and can still be felt today.</p><p>Tracy Borman studied and taught history at the University of Hull and was awarded a PhD in 1997. She went on to a successful career in heritage and has worked for a range of historic properties and national heritage organisations, including the National Archives and English Heritage. She is now Chief Executive of the Heritage Education Trust and also works part-time for Historic Royal Palaces.

Here, in one place, is the best of his previously uncollected material&#x2014;most never before published in book form.<br> &nbsp;<br> David Rakoff&#x2019;s singular personality spills from every page of this witty and entertaining volume, which includes travel features, early fiction works, pop culture criticism, and transcripts of his most memorable appearances on public radio&#x2019;s <i>Fresh Air </i>and <i>This American Life</i>. <br><br>These writings chart his transformation from fish out of water, meekly arriving for college in 1982, to a proud New Yorker bluntly opining on how to walk properly in the city. They show his unparalleled ability to capture the pleasures of solitary pursuits like cooking and crafting, especially in times of trouble; as well as the ups and downs in the life-span of a friendship, whether it is a real relationship or an imaginary correspondence between Gregor Samsa and Dr. Seuss (co-authored with Jonathan Goldstein). Also included is his novel-in-verse <i>Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish</i>. <br> &nbsp;<br> By turns hilarious, incisive and deeply moving, this collection highlights the many facets of Rakoff&#x2019;s huge talent and shows the arc of his remarkable career.<br><br><b>With a foreword by Paul Rudnick.</b></p><p><b>David Rakoff</b>&nbsp;is the author of four&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers: the essay collections&nbsp;<i>Fraud</i>,&nbsp;<i>Don&#x2019;t Get Too Comfortable</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Half Empty,</i>&nbsp;and the novel in verse&nbsp;<i>Love, Dishonor, Marry, Die, Cherish, Perish</i>. A two-time recipient of the Lambda Literary Award and winner of the Thurber Prize for American Humor, he was a regular contributor to Public Radio International&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>This American Life.</i>&nbsp;His writing frequently appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>Newsweek</i>,&nbsp;<i>Wired</i>,&nbsp;<i>Salon</i>,<i>GQ</i>,&nbsp;<i>Outside</i>,&nbsp;<i>Gourmet</i>,&nbsp;<i>Vogue</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Slate</i>, among other publications. An accomplished stage and screen actor, playwright, and screenwriter, he adapted the screenplay for and starred in Joachim Back&#x2019;s film&nbsp;<i>The New Tenants</i>, which won the 2010 Academy Award for Best Live Action Short. He died in 2012.<b>"Goodbye to All of You"</b><br><br>There is an unwritten social code that I learned at university. It is uniquely suited to the archi�tecture of a campus, with its walkways and quadrangles, but it has proven to have universal application. The law is the fol�lowing: If, when you returned after the summer break, you ran into someone on the footpath whom you knew&#x2014;anyone from casual-nod-hello acquaintance all the way up to and includ�ing actual-yet-temporary friend&#x2014;and you did not speak the first time you saw each other that semester, you never had to speak to that person again. Ever. You could nod, you could suck in the necessary breath for the possibility of expelling it in greeting, you could even chuckle at each other in recogni�tion, but if you actually didn&#x2019;t say anything, you were rid of that person. Thereafter, for the rest of your lives, you could engage in the most wonderful, revisionist estrangement; you had never known each other. You could allow yourselves to be introduced to each other at parties and affect a disingenuous, doe-eyed, first-meeting &#x201c;Hi.&#x201d;<br><br>This capacity and desire to slough people off is no less a paradigm for real life than it was for college. Admittedly, in one&#x2019;s student days, it happened far more frequently, casting about furiously for identities as we all were. How embarrassing it was to have come back to school affecting an Urban Marxist People&#x2019;s Poet demeanor only to be confronted with one&#x2019;s old friends from the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society. Life is like a flight. Sometimes you sit beside someone and tell them too much about yourself. Unlike a flight, however, life goes on and on and you can&#x2019;t change planes in Grand Rapids so some�times you just have to change seats. There is no one more worthy of our contempt than somebody who reminds us of who we used to be. Conversely, a true friend is someone who knew you when and doesn&#x2019;t hold it against you.<br><br>There is also a less Stalinist reason for these passive purges: You run out of time as you get older. I have been accused by many friends, as well as by my therapist, of being &#x201c;suspiciously social.&#x201d; This doesn&#x2019;t mean that they think I&#x2019;m a climber, or an Eve Harrington manqu�. They know I&#x2019;m not that. What &#x201c;suspiciously social&#x201d; means is that I am perceived to know and maintain too many relationships with people. If one is friendly to everyone, one is friendly to no one. Of course, this is not actually true. I have a very significant core group of friends who, despite transoceanic migrations, etc., remain the most cohesive social network of my adult life. <br><br>In fact, the bonds get stronger as my social world shrinks. There are, how�ever, many people whom I consider friends who, due to their being single and miserable like myself, spin at high velocity and bump together about once every three months. There are laws that apply here, as well. If, for instance, you have a cold and reschedule once, add three months, and then if the other person gets food poisoning, add three more. There is a quantifiably infinitesimal chance that a third rescheduling will actually bear fruit. This is true for most grown-ups I know.<br><br>Like all good theories, though, there is a seemingly contra�dictory and simultaneous aspect to the rule. If you really want to get rid of someone, a friend who has revealed an unfor�tunate penchant for psychotic episodes, say, or someone who responds to &#x201c;It&#x2019;s such a beautiful day&#x201d; with &#x201c;Thanks, I&#x2019;ve been feeling really attractive,&#x201d; you cannot. It is said that tragedy is sympathetic but chronic problems are alienating. Late-night, ear-bending, soul-baring conversations with friends who tell you that &#x201c;nobody understands me as you do&#x201d; get hard to take as they move into their second decade. It is nice to be needed, but like shelter in a storm, not like dental floss or a really good vegetable peeler. And so, you call less. You reschedule and cancel. You try to create distance. You are a fool, playing a losing game. A game governed by the you-forgot-to-tell-me-that-you-switched-jobs-and-your-home-phone-number-but-I&#x2019;m-glad-I-finally-managed-to-track-you-down principle.<br><br>I can hear the voice of Jane Darwell as Ma Joad here, wondering when I got so hard and mean. It&#x2019;s not meanness that makes me or anyone terminate relationships; I&#x2019;ve been gotten rid of, too. Countless times. When I first moved to New York, I maintained my contacts in Canada steadfastly, but it&#x2019;s not true what they say: Absence doesn&#x2019;t make the heart grow anything. <br>Absence makes you forget. I had a new life that was admittedly more exciting than my old one. I came out, which distanced me yet further, and my friends back home responded in kind, having lives of their own.<br><br>I did have one friend, however, who used to call me, her voice fairly sawtoothed with umbrage. The very existence of my new life constituted a betrayal. I superegotistically back�slid and apologized for years, terrified that I was in fact guilty of her silent accusation that I now felt myself to be superior. I, in turn, would roll my eyes on the other end of the phone at her anecdotes about the same old people, her inertia, the smallness of her dreams, the Narrowness of her Worldview (I really did use these terms&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not proud, I&#x2019;m trying to be honest). But one day, I just stopped. I took the note of contri�tion out of my voice. I talked about my life without trying to mollify her by disqualifying its importance to me. It is only years later that I see that at the same time I stopped apologiz�ing, she stopped trying to exact those assurances from me that our relationship had not changed. We both knew it had and we both were finally comfortable about it. Recently, on a trip home, I called her. Not to make plans to see her&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t have time, nor did she&#x2014;but simply to say hello. After years of avoiding walking by her house when I visited my parents, I got over my narcissistic fantasy that she was inside, sobbing, lying in wait so she could heap upon me recriminations of neglect and heartlessness. For the first time, I did not feel like I had wounded her when I put the phone down.<br><br>A boyfriend once explained to me his leaving New York for Los Angeles this way: &#x201c;You know when Joan Didion has that man say in &#x2018;Goodbye to All That&#x2019; that there comes a time in New York City when you&#x2019;ve slept with all the women in the room and borrowed money from all the men? Well, that&#x2019;s why I have to leave, but I&#x2019;ve borrowed money from all the women and slept with all the men.&#x201d;<br><br>When he told me this, I could only focus on the part about him having slept with all the men, but I know now what he means. It doesn&#x2019;t necessarily make one a bad person to lose touch with someone or leave them behind, no matter what the emotional or carnal bonds once were between you. Peo�ple get used up. It sounds horribly callous, but it&#x2019;s true. The term is &#x201c;tossed aside like an old shoe&#x201d;&#x2014;not a bad shoe, just an old one. There&#x2019;s a false moral component operating here. It&#x2019;s hard enough to simply grow up; don&#x2019;t confuse the issue by not allowing yourself to lose contact with people who have now become strangers to you. The movies lie: sometimes you won&#x2019;t always have Paris, and what&#x2019;s more, you&#x2019;ll neither of you particularly care. <br>Although there is an occasional attendant sorrow, it&#x2019;s evident the art of losing&#x2019;s not too hard to master.<br><br>I was recently walking one Saturday morning and passed a store I had been inside a few hours previously. I looked through the plate glass and there, like a flimsy plot device in a bad movie, I saw an ex-friend looking around. I don&#x2019;t mean an old friend, which is how I refer to people in Toronto. He is my only true ex-friend, and there he was in the housewares section of Barneys.<br> When we first became close, several years ago, he issued me a warning:<br><br>&#x201c;I get tired of people after two years or so. I get really inti�mate, and then I get tired of them. I&#x2019;ll probably get rid of you, too.&#x201d; He laughed and covered his mouth, mock-shocked at his own cynicism.<br><br>I issued the counter-warning that he wouldn&#x2019;t be able to dismiss me so easily. I liked this banter. It had a Hepburn-Tracy antagonism that I enjoyed and it felt like he was laying down a romantic gauntlet to me, which may well have been the root of my problem. His lover was sick, and I felt needed and up to the challenge of proving him wrong and sticking around for the long haul.<br><br>We became good friends. We filled niches in each other&#x2019;s lives that seemed dangerously close to the role of soul mates or lovers. In very little time, our discourse consisted almost entirely of inside jokes, catchphrases, and partial aphorisms. I would pick up the phone at work, and he would be saying in his best Ruth Draper, &#x201c;My dear, this is not for the children&#x2019;s ears. Meet me at the Royalton.&#x201d;<br><br>We cared for his dying boyfriend. I sat with him in the church at the memorial service, when his in-laws would not acknowledge him. And then something soured. It was pre�cipitous, this disaffection. Maybe it had been developing all along but, if so, it had been concealed, occupied as we were with caring for his lover. But suddenly, there it was: biting into a perfect-skinned apple to find it full of rot. Both of us felt unacknowledged, censored, unrespected, and unloved by the other. Perhaps, in the absence of a shared crisis, we battled each other. But I actually think I had reached a point of satu�ration with my role as the subordinate caring one. Or maybe I was just angry he hadn&#x2019;t fallen in love with me. We spoke about it one night and agreed we would have to work harder at the friendship. We came away from that evening unconvinced and dissatisfied. I then went away for a weekend. I didn&#x2019;t call before I left and didn&#x2019;t call when I got back. We haven&#x2019;t con�tacted each other since. I don&#x2019;t feel gotten rid of in this case. It is both our faults. His two-year prediction of expiry was merely an unfortunate coincidence.<br><br>I watched him looking around the store, unaware of me. I had no discernible feelings watching him, none of the nausea of seeing an old boyfriend, for example. I was Stella Dallas minus the rain and the handkerchief between my teeth. And then, as if he had seen me through the glass earlier that morn�ing when I had done the very same thing, he stopped in front of a bowlful of red-and-yellow parrot tulips. Among shelves of overdecorated vases, trays, crystal, and other articles of house�hold pornography, he leaned in to them, closing his eyes, con�centrating on the one real thing that was there.<br><br><i>[</i>Out<i>, May 1994.

Many of the adornments made in Nubia are masterpieces of the jeweler&#x2019;s art&#x2015;marvels of design and construction rivaling, and often surpassing, adornments made in Egypt and the rest of the ancient Mediterranean world. Although these unique treasures are among the most stunning to have survived from antiquity, they remain little known.<br>Richly illustrated with beautiful photographs of these exquisite items, many of them never before published, Nubian Gold also places the jewelry within the cultural contexts in which it was manufactured and employed. It tells the story not only of the treasures themselves but of the exciting tales of their discovery and the rich background of the exotic and remote civilizations that produced them.<br>The book also explores the innovative techniques used to procure the precious materials used in the jewelry and to craft them into intricate ornaments replete with magical purpose and coded meaning. Featured in the book are not only the intricately crafted pieces themselves but depictions of them in sculpture, relief, and painting as well as references to them in ancient texts, locating them within the full spectrum of Nubian history, from the earliest beginnings of society to the advent of Christianity.</p><p>Peter Lacovara is director of the Ancient Egyptian Heritage and Archaeology Fund.

Eyes of Horus is the story, told in the first person, of Ra-ab, heir to the Nomarch of the Oryx, one of eighteen provinces in Egypt. He comes to learn that the Oryx is different than the rest of Egypt-it is still in touch with the light. The rest of Egypt is plagued by fear and ruled by corruption. Pharaoh is an ineffectual ruler. The priests have replaced the worship of Ptah with the worship of Set. Only the Oryx has cast off these shackles-and it is from the Oryx that a silent brotherhood of the &#39;eyes of Horus&#39;-the Watchers of the Horizon-arises, to work and wait for the dawn of a new age in Egypt. &#39;Send Fear into Exile&#39;, is the Watchers&#39; password, and when the time is ripe, Ra-ab leads the Oryx and its followers to victory-and a new Egypt. As a child growing up in Edwardian England, Joan Grant became aware of an astonishing ability to remember previous lifetimes, and as an author professed her seven novels to be based on her personal recollections of other incarnations, male and female, in ancient civilisations. &#34;This book is warm with the sunshine of Egypt, delicate with the beauty of its homes and palaces, its surpassing art... there are also stories of graft, of insolent luxury... but through all runs the spirit of chivalry and heroism and faith.&#34; Times Literary Supplement</p><p>Joan Grant authored a set of 7 remarkable novels, in which she recaptures the drama and setting of one of her own previous lives.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. The astral plane, also called the astral world, is a plane of existence postulated by classical (particularly neo-Platonic), medieval, oriental and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. It is the world of the planetary spheres, crossed by the soul in its astral body on the way to being born and after death, and generally said to be populated by angels, spirits or other immaterial beings. In the late 19th and early 20th century the term was popularized by Theosophy and Neo-Rosicrucianism. Leadbeater&#39;s account is one of the most enduring. Charles Webster Leadbeater was an influential member of the Theosophical Society, an author on occult subjects and an associate of Annie Besant. Leadbeater went on to write over 69 books and pamphlets that examined in detail the hidden side of life as well as maintain regular speaking engagements. His efforts on behalf of the society assured his status as one of its leading members until his death in 1934.</p><p>Charles Webster Leadbeater (1847-1934) was a Church of England clergyman until he joined the Theosophical Society in 1883. He spent some years in Sri Lanka working for the revival of Buddhism, and later became the Presiding Bishop of the Liberal Catholic Church, which seeks to combine the preservation of the Catholic sacraments with the widest measure of freedom of thought and interpretation of the scriptures. He was a highly developed clairvoyant and the author of over thirty books on the spiritual life and on the psychic nature of man. He unfolded and perfected his own psychic faculties under the guidance of his Adept teacher and in 1893 began his clairvoyant investigations, on occasion collaborating with Annie Besant, the second President of the Theosophical Society. His worldwide lectures presented a new viewpoint to thousands of people.</p><h2>Wilson: The Origins of the Wilsons and Their Place in History (Scottish Clan Mini-Book)</h2><p>Bearers of the surname Wilson have left an indelible mark on the pages of Scotland&#39;s vibrant story; as kinsfolk of two proud clans, they are heirs to the romance and drama attached to the Highlands, while some of their forebears were key characters in notorious episodes that stain the nation&#39;s history.

That's why the saints are not only models of holiness for us to imitate; they're reminders that God's grace can outshine every human flaw.</p> <p>As Alban Goodier's classic <em>Saints for Sinners</em> shows us, even the greatest saints had to battle the same stubborn vices, temptations of the flesh, and bouts of spiritual dryness that afflict you and me today. In these pages, with a style that perfectly blends hagiographical detail, spiritual meditation, and a skilled storyteller's touch, Archbishop Goodier brings us the tales of:</p> <ul> <li>�The mercenary fighting man and itinerant gambler who left behind his rough soldier's habits and founded a religious order to care for the sick </li><li>�The backward, sickly teenager, disowned by his family and dogged by the Inquisition, who became a miraculous healer and paragon of humble simplicity</li><li>�The willful Tuscan beauty with a bad reputation who forsook vanity and lust to answer God's call to live in poverty and penitence&lt; </li><li>�The brilliant, brooding Spanish nobleman who gave up everything to be a missionary only to see most of his efforts fail </li><li>�The royal chaplain and daring Counter-Reformer who escaped the gallows but had to endure a lifelong interior martyrdom of doubt and discouragement </li><li>�The hedonistic heretic and womanizer who traded worldly pleasure for divine happiness, and became one of the Church's greatest theologians </li><li>�And other inspiring tales of imperfect souls "made perfect in infirmity"</li></ul><p>Read these stories and find in them delight and encouragement, as well as hope. You'll come to see that there is no one so sinful, weak, or desolate that God has not already raised another like him to the heights of glory.</p></p><p>The Most Rev. Alban Goodier (1869-1939) was a Jesuit who served as archbishop of Bombay, India. A well-respected spiritual writer, he penned over a dozen books and was renowned for his memorable aphorisms.</p><h2>The Way of the Japanese Bath - 3rd edition</h2><p>This award-winning book celebrates the Japanese hot spring. From the introduction: While all the primeval geological and geothermal rumblings under Japan have set off devastating volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, and earthquakes (ten percent of the world&#39;s volcanic activity occurs in Japan), they have also provided the 126 million inhabitants of the island nation on the Ring of Fire with a very unique way of life. An estimated 100 million people check in each year at onsen (hot spring) ryokans( Japanese style inns) or hotels, often to escape the extreme stress-inducing population density. The 20,000 thermal hot springs that flow from the ground have become meccas, a place to bathe not only the body but the soul as well. Noboribetsu in Hokkaido is one of the most popular onsen towns because of its variety of waters with medicinal benefits yet most water is classified as simple thermal and most onsen visitors come for simple relaxation. People often shed their city clothes for the duration of their visits and stroll the streets of these onsen towns dressed in yukata - bath (yu) garment (kata). Humans are not the only creatures to take advantage of the onsens. Snow monkeys (Japanese macaques) are regular patrons at Jigokudani in Joshinetsu Plateau National Park in northeastern Nagano Prefecture. Back at home in even the smallest apartments, a deep bathtub can be found for this same meditative soaking. After sitting on a small stool and rinsing off, you immerse yourself in the tub. After your bath, a plastic roll up top is placed back on the top of the tub to keep the heat in for the next member of the household. Only after every one has taken a bath - including overnight house guests - will the water be drained. Author/photographer Mark Edward Harris had his first Japanese hot spring experience in Beppu, a town often shrouded in water vapor on the southern island of Kyushu, converted me into a furo-aholic (bath-aholic) in the early 1990s. Three decades and three editions of The Way of the Japanese Bath later he still finds the magical waters an endless source of both visual and visceral pleasure.</p><p>After graduating from California State University, Los Angeles with a Master of Arts Degree in Pictorial/Documentary History, Mark Edward Harris started his professional photography career doing the stills for the Merv Griffin Show and various television and movie companies. When the show ended in 1986 he set off on a four-month trek across the Pacific and throughout Southeast Asia, China and Japan. The images created on that trip brought attention to his travel and documentary photography. He since has visited and photographed in ninety countries. His editorial work has appeared in publications including Vanity Fair, LIFE, Time, GEO, Wallpaper, Stern, Conde Nast Traveler, National Geographic Traveler, Forbes Life, AFAR, Islands, TravelAge West, Travel Weekly, Playboy, Vogue Brazil, Elle Canada, Elle Decoration Russia, Esquire Japan, Harper s Bazaar, Italian GQ, Marie Claire, W Magazine, The New York Times, The London Sunday Times Magazine, The Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine, as well as many photography and airline in-flight magazines. His commercial clients range from The Gap for his fashion photography, Coca-Cola for portraiture, to cruise lines airlines and government tourist bureaus for his travel photography. He is the recipient of numerous awards including a CLIO Award for advertising photography, an Aurora Gold Award for commercial directing and an ACE Award for directing and producing a video for television. In the spring of 1998 Abbeville Press published Mark s book Faces of the Twentieth Century: Master Photographers and Their Work recording in both words and pictures many of the great names in photography. In March of 1999, the book won the prestigious New York Book Show Photography Book of the Year and Best of Show awards. Mark s book The Way of the Japanese Bath (R.A.M. Publications), winner of a Premier Print Award, was published in February 2003 to coincide with a touring exhibition beginning at APEX Fine Art in Los Angeles. His third book Mark Edward Harris: Wanderlust (R.A.M. Publications) was released in November 2004. Images in that book led Mark to being named Photographer of the Year at the 2004 Black + White Spider Awards and the book itself being named the people/photography book of the year at the 2005 International Photography Awards. Domicilium Decoratus (Harper/Collins), collaboration with award-winning interior designer Kelly Wearstler, was released in 2006. In 2007 Chronicle Books published his book Inside North Korea. A revised edition of Wanderlust was also published in the same year and was the recipient of the first place award for Fine Art Books at the Prix del la Photographie Paris (PX3). In September 2008 Chronicle Books published Inside Iran. In 2009 a revised and expanded edition of The Way of the Japanese Bath was released. The book was selected as one of PDN s photo books of the year in 2010 as well as an IPA award. Mark is a contributing editor for publications in the film and photography field including Digital Photo Pro, Outdoor Photographer, and Black &amp; White. He is also a contributing editor for Travel Weekly. Harris shares his photographic knowledge through teaching photography workshops around the globe. In 2012, he was a keynote speaker in Yokohama at the International Travel Mart presenting his series on Japanese ryokans and hot springs and at the Travel Photography Festival at the Royal Geographical Society in London. In 2013 his first book on South Korea and his second book on North Korea were released with a book tour including stops at the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena, the Korea Society in New York, and the Newseum in Washington, DC. North Korea was named Photography Book of the Year at the International Photography Awards.

Stuart Hall's book provides an excellent introduction, both scholarly and accesible, to the formative period on which any recognizable version of Christianity will continue to depend."<br>--Geoffrey Wainwright<br>Cushman Professor of Systematic Theology in the Divinity School of Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.<br><br>"Hall walks with the scholar's ease and grace through the ancient texts. His book has the advantage of treating more explicitly the liturgical practice of the ancient church, in addition to key persons, doctrinal issues, and movements. . . . The author's literary skill enhances what could have been a heavy technical presentation, making the book suitable for classroom use. . . . Scholars will find fresh perspectives on old issues."<br>--Kilian McDonnel, OSB, STD<br>Priest, theologian, and monk of Saint John's Abbey, Collegeville, Minnesota --Wipf and Stock Publishers</p><h2>AN American Radical: A Political Prisoner in My Own Country</h2><p>On a November night in 1984, Susan Rosenberg sat in the passenger seat of a U-Haul as it swerved along the New Jersey Turnpike. At the wheel was a fellow political activist. In the back were 740 pounds of dynamite and assorted guns. That night I still believed with all my heart that what Che Guevara had said about revolutionaries being motivated by love was true. I also believed that our government ruled the world by force and that it was necessary to oppose it with force. Raised on New York City&#39;s Upper West Side, Rosenberg had been politically active since high school, involved in the black liberation movement and protesting repressive U.S. policies around the world and here at home. At twenty-nine, she was on the FBI&#39;s Most Wanted list. While unloading the U-Haul at a storage facility, Rosenberg was arrested and sentenced to an unprecedented 58 years for possession of weapons and explosives. I could not see the long distance I had traveled from my commitment to justice and equality to stockpiling guns and dynamite. Seeing that would take years. Rosenberg served sixteen years in some of the worst maximum-security prisons in the United States before being pardoned by President Clinton as he left office in 2001. Now, in a story that is both a powerful memoir and a profound indictment of the U.S. prison system, Rosenberg recounts her journey from the impassioned idealism of the 1960s to life as a political prisoner in her own country, subjected to dehumanizing treatment, yet touched by moments of grace and solidarity. Candid and eloquent, An American Radical reveals the woman behind the controversy--and reflects America&#39;s turbulent coming-of-age over the past half century.</p><p>A passionate 1960s-era protester whose radical beliefs were honed in the antiwar and black liberation movements of the time, Rosenberg was a proponent, if not an actual perpetrator, of violence in the name of antiestablishment causes. Placed on the FBIs most-wanted list in 1982 for her role in a notorious crime in which two policemen were killed, Rosenberg went underground. Two years later, she was apprehended in the act of transporting a cache of explosives across state lines. The trial was swift, the sentence severe: 58 years in maximum security. In stark and searing prose, Rosenberg chronicles her hellish journey through the American prison system during a 16-year period in which she was brutalized, demoralized, and subjected to the most heinous treatment the countrys judicial system had to offer. Eventually pardoned by President Bill Clinton on his last day in office, Rosenberg credits her ability to survive to an indomitable sense of self, one that was sharpened by degrading horror. Not easy to read but important to encounter. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>Flower Festival: 50 Applique Blocks to Grow Your Garden 9 Quilt Projects</h2><p>Create a whole bouquet of floral quilts with 50 adorable mix-and-match blocks of appliqu,d flowers and bugs. 9 projects.</p><p>Kim Schaefer began sewing at an early age and was quilting seriously by the late 1980s.

Winner of the 2016 Frost Place Chapbook Competition. "EQUILIBRIUM searches for that point where there is a balance, even as the poems display a consciousness and self-awareness that belie that balance. The poems negotiate the colossal movement of hearts figuring and being figured by history. This is a voice that knows the intelligence of passion, that moves through and inside the questioning of who we are in the structures of things we give the power to name us until a song sends us out to question the territory. The poet moves with the exactness of math or physics, with the fearful knowledge of careful imbalances that would have us believe in equilibrium, and with the assuredness of art that knows all is change, that the semblance of order is creation, something we are given the gift of imitating in some small way. The poems in this collection summon the largeness, the volume of a voice that disembodies itself in order to search for the love that made it whole." &#x2014;Afaa Michael Weaver</p><p>Tiana Clark is the winner of the 2016 Academy of American Poets Prize and the 2015 Rattle Poetry Prize.

And it is still more curious that <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, George Eliot&#x2019;s last novel, should have been dismissed, by many of her admirers at the time and by some critics since, as something of an anomaly, an inexplicable and unfortunate turn in her life and work.<br><br>Yet Eliot herself was passionately committed to that novel, having prepared herself for it by an extraordinary feat of scholarly research in five languages (including Hebrew), exploring the ancient, medieval, and modern sources of Jewish history. Three years later, to reenforce that commitment, she wrote an essay, the very last of her writing, reaffirming the heritage of the Jewish nation&#x201d; and the desirability of a Jewish state this well before the founders of Zionism had conceived of that mission.<br><br>Why did this Victorian novelist, born a Christian and an early convert to agnosticism, write a book so respectful of Judaism and so prescient about Zionism? And why at a time when there were no pogroms or persecutions to provoke her? What was the general conception of the Jewish question,&#x201d; and how did Eliot reinterpret that question,&#x201d; for her time as well as ours? <br><br>Gertrude Himmelfarb, a leading Victorian scholar, has undertaken to unravel the mysteries of <i>Daniel Deronda</i>. And the mysteries of Eliot herself: a novelist who deliberately wrote a book she knew would bewilder many of her readers, a distinguished woman who opposed the enfranchisement of women, a moralist who flouted the most venerable of marital conventions above all, the author of a novel that is still an inspiration or provocation to readers and critics alike.<br></p><p>Gertrude Himmelfarb, professor emeritus at the Graduate School of the City University, has written extensively on intellectual and cultural history with a focus on Victorian England. Her most recent books are <i>The Moral Imagination: From Edmund Burke to Lionel Trilling</i> and <i>The Roads to Modernity: The British, French, and American Enlightenments</i>. She is a Fellow of the British Academy and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2004 she received the National Humanities Medal awarded by the President. <br>In this groundbreaking study of George Eliot, Gertrude Himmelfarb offers a fascinating and deeply persuasive understanding of Eliot&#x2019;s extraordinary sympathy for Jewish identity, Jewish religion, and ultimately, Jewish nationalism. A work of rare originality and insight. Simply brilliant.&#x201d;<br> Charles Krauthammer<br><br> In this compelling and inspiring narrative, elegantly woven from strands historical, biographical, philosophical, and literary, our finest historian of Victorian England provides a brilliant interpretation of <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, the final novel of Victorian England&#x2019;s greatest novelist, vindicating its artistic integrity and intellectual importance against its many critics. Ms. Himmelfarb also illuminates George Eliot&#x2019;s remarkably prescient and still relevant perspectives on Zionism and the Jewish Question,&#x201d; concluding with her own profound reflections on the intimate connections of religion and politics to personal identity. A <i>tour de force</i>.&#x201d;<br> Leon R. Kass and Amy A. Kass, The University of Chicago<br><br> In <i>The Jewish Odyssey of George Eliot</i>, a brave and bravura excavation of a prophetic artist&#x2019;s mind, Gertrude Himmelfarb at last opens to us the George Eliot who has too long been snubbed sometimes on aesthetic grounds, but more often with full disparaging intent. In so doing, Himmelfarb catapults George Eliot into the thick of the great central maelstrom of our own moment, when <i>Daniel Deronda</i> ceases to be a Victorian novel only, and boldly enters the twenty-first century. Through the lenses of history, culture, philosophy, politics, and literary art, Himmelfarb, in this innovative and dazzling study, reveals how <i>Daniel Deronda</i> not unlike <i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin</i> has had its role in succoring and renewing a people; and how it serves as a prescient rebuke to both Sartre and Said.<br> Cynthia Ozick<br><br> Gertrude Himmelfarb leads us through the mystery of why, in the 1870s, Britain's leading novelist, a woman with no Jewish connections, should have chosen to write a book about Jewish identity and the return to Zion.

It was not until he was twenty-two, when he fought alongside his people&#x201d; against the Creek Indians, a neighboring rebel tribe, that he knew the Cherokees&#x2019; fate would be his. Cherokee chief for forty years, he would guide the tribe through, its most turbulent period.<br><br>As increasing numbers of whites settled illegally on the Cherokee Nation&#x2019;s native land, including Ross&#x2019;s beloved home at Head of Coosa, the chief remained steadfast in his refusal to sign a treaty agreeing to removal. When a group of renegade Cherokees betrayed him and negotiated an agreement with Jackson&#x2019;s men behind Ross&#x2019;s back, he was forced to give way and begin the journey west.<br><br>In one of America&#x2019;s great tragedies, thousands of Cherokees died during the tribe&#x2019;s migration on the Trail of Tears to Oklahoma.<br></p><p>Brian Hicks is a senior writer for <i>The Post and Courier</i> in Charleston, S.C. where he lives. This is his fifth book on Cherokee heritage.<br>When Harris cocked his rifle, Ross wheeled his horse around and galloped off, retreating by the sound of the gun&#x2019;s report. Ross knew the countryside well, and that knowledge gave him an advantage in the dark. He rode fast, knowing that it was not only himself, but the entire Cherokee Nation he had to save. The tribe depended on him; there was no one else who could stop Jackson.<br><br> Even though the attack made his blood boil, turning to fight never occurred to Ross. He was not a warrior, and he knew it. Ross&#x2019;s only thoughts were of escape. Although it would have been natural to be afraid, Ross was more annoyed than anything else. The attack was just something else standing in the way of his business. He knew that he must get away, but he still had much work to do.<br><br>Andrew caught up to Ross within minutes, and the two rode quickly and quietly through the night. After a while, they turned off the trail that led to Coodey&#x2019;s, not wanting to bring this trouble on their nephew.<br><br> As his horse sprinted, dodging branches on the narrow trail, John Ross had little time to wonder who had sent this man Harris. Had it been the governor of Georgia, the president of the United States, or one of his own tribesmen? In truth, he knew it mattered very little at that moment, because he could hear the man gaining.<br><br> And then, another shot rang out in the dark.<br></p><h2>The Life of Saint Augustine: A Translation of the Sancti Augustini Vita by Possidius, Bishop of Calama (Christian Roman Empire Series)</h2><p>Few figures from antiquity are as well known to us as Augustine of Hippo. Thanks to his Confessions, we know a great deal about Augustine's life prior to his conversion to Christianity. Yet, without this little biography written by his intimate friend Possidius, bishop of Calama, we would know comparatively little about Augustine s life after his baptism.<br><br>In straight-forward, unadorned prose, Possidius shows Augustine as a powerful intellect, voluminous writer, and compelling orator, willing and able to defend the Church against all comers be they pagans, Donatists, Arians or Manichaeans. But he also presents an Augustine who humbly endured the everyday trials and difficulties of life as a bishop in Roman Africa. He shows a man who ate sparingly, worked tirelessly, despised gossip, shunned the temptations of the flesh, and exercised prudence and frugality in the financial stewardship of his see.<br><br>Possidius also supplies one of the only first-hand descriptions of the great tragedy of Augustine's life--the Vandalic conquest of Roman Africa. He poignantly describes Augustine's final illness as he lay locked inside Hippo Regius with the barbarian host literally at the city gates.<br><br>More than simply the biography of a great saint, The Life of Saint Augustine provides a tantalizing glimpse into life in late Roman Africa--a prosperous society on the verge of destruction.<br><br>This edition of Weiskotten's translation has been completely re-typeset for the modern reader.

As Kafka s nightmare city and home of the Good Soldier _vejk, the Czech capital also produced two of the twentieth century s emblematic writers. Richard Burton explores this metropolis of theatrical allusion, in which politics and drama have always been intertwined. His interpretation of the city s cultural past and present encompasses opera and rock music, puppetry and cinema, surrealism and socialist realism. Looking at Prague s world-famous landmarks and lesser-known sites, his reading of the city through its writing and iconography is both perceptive and challenging.<br><br>* THE CITY OF ARTISTS AND WRITERS: The Castle and Kafka, Ha_ek and Kundera; music from Smetana to the Plastic People of the Universe; modernism and cubism; political theater and the playwright-president V�clav Havel.<br><br>* THE CITY OF TYRANNY AND RESISTANCE: Jan Hus and anti-Catholic revolt; subjugation and the rise of Czech nationalism; Germans, Czechs and Jews; "Prague Spring" 1968, Charter 77 and the "Velvet Revolution" of November 1989.<br><br>* THE CITY OF MAGIC, MURDER, AND MYTH: Medieval alchemy and astrology; the myth of the Golem, the ghetto and anti-Semitism; living puppets, robots, and a tradition of defenestration.</p><p>Richard Burton was formerly Professor of French and Francophone Studies at Sussex University.

Gabe Conway is miserable because his guardian, Uncle Steve, a peripatetic professor of the occult, is about to move their family away from Gabe's friends Kazuo "Kaz" Smith and twins Brett and Lily Hernandez. As a final adventure before Gabe's departure, the buddies steal a map from Gabe's uncle and follow it to a secret chamber within the city's old sewer tunnels. There, in what they think is a meaningless ritual, they bind themselves to one another and to the four elements of earth, air, water, and fire. The ritual turns out to be the real thing, and it sets off a lot of creepy consequences. What saves this book from the utter predictability of its setup are the gradual unfolding of characters' hidden motivations and the true scariness of the evil creatures released by the companions' explorations. While their ages and grades are never stated, the adventurers interact like middle schoolers. Their ethnicities reflect the cultural diversity of San Francisco, but the novel doesn't mention race or culture beyond a few Spanish words and some references to tea. Just a touch of self-aware humor leavens the blend of peril and action that drive the plot. As Kaz says of a newly discovered danger, "A cult. Of course it's a cult. And not just any cult! A magical doomsday cult! The only thing that would make it better is if aliens figured in somehow." Indeed. VERDICT Extremely entertaining and sure to be popular with fans of Rick Riordan's "Percy Jackson" books and the "39 Clues" series.&#x2014;Beth Wright Redford, Richmond Elementary School Library, VT</p><h2>Illusion: Chronicles of Nick (Chronicles of Nick, 5)</h2><p><p>Be careful what you wish for. . . You just might get it.</p><p> Nick Gautier is tired of his destiny. He doesn't want to be the son of a demon who's fated to end the world. Nor does he want to see another demon or other preternatural creature who wants to kill or enslave him. He just wants to be normal teenager and have normal problems like everyone else.<br> But normality isn't all it's cracked up to be. When he gets sucked into an alternate reality where his mother has married his mentor and his Atlantean god best friend has become a human geek, he begins to understand that no life is free of pain, and that every person has a specific place in the universe . . . even the son of a hated demon. Most of all, he sees that his powers aren't the curse he thought they were, and that the world needs a champion, especially a champion the world's enemies can't imagine rising up to defend the very people he should destroy. <br> Old enemies and new friends square off for a major battle that will either restore Nick to his real world, or end him forever</p></p><p>New York Times bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon is a regular in the #1 spot.

You&#x2019;re going to be late for school.&#x201d; <br>Groaning in fear of what he might find this time, Nick opened his eyes to see the navy blue curtains his mom had bought him last year when they moved into their condo on Bourbon Street. Relief flooded him. <br> <i>It was just a nightmare, after all. Thank you, God!</i> <br>That was his thought until he realized that the window wasn&#x2019;t the same. Instead of being a large single window, it was two windows with a divider between them. <br>Ah, crap. Not again. <i>Haven&#x2019;t I suffered enough indignities and horrors? Really?</i> <br>His heart hammering, Nick slowly swept his gaze around a room he didn&#x2019;t recognize. <br>At all. <br>His stomach tightened to the point he feared he&#x2019;d be ill. <br>&#x201c;Nick?&#x201d; His mom knocked lightly before she pushed open the door to smile at him. &#x201c;So you are up, sleepyhead. Hurry now, or else you&#x2019;ll get another tardy.&#x201d; <br>Even more unsettled than before, Nick gaped at the sight of her in an expensive dark blue business suit with her blond hair cut short to frame her beautiful face. That definitely wasn&#x2019;t her waitress uniform. <br>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; <br>Scowling, she moved to stand by the bed and placed her hand to his forehead. &#x201c;Are you all right? You look pale.&#x201d; <br>Stunned, he couldn&#x2019;t speak as he stared at a stranger in his mother&#x2019;s body. <br>&#x201c;Cherise? It&#x2019;s London calling. They need to speak to you. Said it can&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d; <br>His eyes widened at the sound of that familiar deep, thick Tennessee Southern drawl. Bubba? What the heck was Bubba doing in his house at seven thirty in the morning? It&#x2019;d been bad enough when Nick had come home from the prom and found him here. But that he&#x2019;d attributed to a date. <br>No, wait. That wasn&#x2019;t right. Someone had told him at the prom that Bubba was his father now. Caleb? <br>For some reason, he couldn&#x2019;t remember. <br>And why in the world would someone in London call his mom? <br> <i>Maybe London&#x2019;s a name?</i> <br>No. Not possible. This was bad bad. His mom didn&#x2019;t know anyone named London.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right there, Michael.&#x201d; She squeezed Nick&#x2019;s cheek. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have a fever. Did you stay up too late?&#x201d; <br>Honestly? He feared some kind of terminal brain damage. How hard had that demon slammed him on the ground while they fought to get his mom back? <br>His door opened again to show &#x201c;Bubba&#x201d; in a black Armani suit. Nick only knew that designer brand because they were the ones his immortal boss, Kyrian, favored and Nick had had a seizure the first time he&#x2019;d gone to pick one up and had seen the cost of it. <br>Who wore that stuff and why? <br>Huge as ever, Bubba had abandoned his beard for smooth cheeks and wore a short, stylish cut. Yeah, this definitely wasn&#x2019;t the burly redneck who hunted zombies in the bayou with his lunatic best friend. One who was paranoid as all get out, and armed to a level that the ATF had him on their watch list. <br>As if he hadn&#x2019;t morphed into some creepy businessman, Bubba came in and handed a cordless phone to his mom. <br>Removing her expensive earring, she cupped her hand over the mouthpiece and whispered to Bubba. &#x201c;I think our Boo is sick. See what you think.&#x201d; She stepped out of the room to deal with her call. <br>Bubba knelt his gigantic form by the bed and brushed the hair back from Nick&#x2019;s forehead. &#x201c;You all right, buddy?&#x201d; Now there was a loving tone Bubba had never used with him before. That was even more terrifying than having a Charonte demon try to eat him. <br>Completely dumbfounded by it all, Nick dropped his gaze to the huge football championship ring on Bubba&#x2019;s hand. The diamonds on the front formed a pattern reminiscent of a fleur-de-lis. They were framed by the words &#x201c;Forty&#x201d; on one side and &#x201c;Niners&#x201d; on the other. The name &#x201c;Burdette&#x201d; was on the &#x201c;Forty&#x201d; side and &#x201c;Super Bowl XXIV 55-10&#x201d; on the &#x201c;Niners&#x201d; side. Gasping, he fingered the ring as he remembered Bubba&#x2019;s mama telling him how Bubba could have gone pro after college, but had decided to stay home with his wife and son instead. &#x201c;This looks so real.&#x201d; <br>Bubba snorted. &#x201c;It is real, you know that.&#x201d; He duplicated Nick&#x2019;s scowl. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on with you, Squirt? You have a test you&#x2019;re trying to avoid?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No. I&nbsp;&#x2026; uh&nbsp;&#x2026; yeah, no, I&#x2019;m fine. Not a morning person.&#x201d; <br>Laughing, Bubba stood up and pulled the covers off Nick. &#x201c;Come on. Mom made pancakes for breakfast and they&#x2019;re getting cold.&#x201d; He left the room. <br>Still disoriented and confused, Nick rolled out of bed. This was so screwed up. Raking his hand through his hair, he gaped at the photo on his desk of a sweaty Bubba in a 49ers uniform holding him as a toddler, dressed in a matching 49ers jersey with BURDETTE on the back. At least Nick thought it was him. The face and blond hair belonged to the stranger he kept seeing in the mirror. It was a picture from a newspaper where the 49ers had won the Super Bowl, January 28, 1990. <br>What the heck? <br>In 1990, Nick would have been six. The &#x201c;Nick&#x201d; in the photo couldn&#x2019;t be more than three or four. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in another coma.&#x201d; At least <i>that</i> made sense to his scrambled mind. <br>Yeah, he could definitely go with that. Instead of being sent to the Nether Realm, he was trapped here, wherever <i>here</i> was. Caleb or Kody would wake him up at any moment and everything would be back to normal. He just had to make sure he didn&#x2019;t get sucked into a hell realm and eaten by a demon or zombie until they figured this out and performed another rescue mission. <br> <i>C&#x2019;mon guys, hurry</i>. He wasn&#x2019;t sure how long his sanity would hold. <br>Cringing at what he saw in the bathroom mirror, he curled his lip. Gah, it was so strange to see someone else peering back at him. While he&#x2019;d never been vain, he missed the way he used to look. The dark hair. <br>And height. He really missed being tall. Short sucked. How did short guys stand it? <br> <i>Give me growing pains any day over this</i>. <br>Turning on the shower, he took a moment to replay the last events he remembered through his mind. He&#x2019;d been in <i>Le Monde au Del� du Voile</i>&#x2014;the world behind the veil&#x2014;where his mother had been taken after being kidnapped by demons. He, along with Kody and Caleb, had fought off the huge demonic werewolf Zavid and demons to get her and his father out. His dad had died in the fighting and he&#x2019;d given Nick all of his Malachai powers. Powers Caleb and Kody had bound up tight until Nick could learn to use them, and to better protect him from the supernatural predators that wanted to kill him and take those powers for themselves. <br>Nick froze as another fear went through him. His powers were forever malfunctioning. Could the binding potion from last night be the reason for all of this? Had it backfired and changed everything? <br>Made sense. He&#x2019;d once turned his friend Madaug into a goat by mistake. Maybe the potion last night had turned Madaug into a douche.&#x2026; <br> <i>And me into a short loser.</i> <br>As he left the shower, he winced at his reflection. &#x201c;And I thought I was skinny before.&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Dog, he looked awful. His arms were so frail, he was surprised he didn&#x2019;t snap them off reaching for the towel. Not the image he wanted for the rest of his life. Toweling his now-blond hair, he tried not to think about it as he dressed and headed downstairs. The only good thing about this weird life was the lack of tacky Hawaiian shirts in his closet. It appeared his mom had finally let go of her <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> fetish and gone shopping somewhere other than Goodwill. <br>He paused on the stairs to gape at the photos of him, his mom, and Bubba from Nick&#x2019;s birth to high school. <i>Dang, is there not one incarnation of my life in any alternate universe where my mom didn&#x2019;t take a photo of me naked in the bathtub with a rubber duck? Really?</i> He didn&#x2019;t know what was more shocking, those weird non-doctored photos or the massive size of this humongous house. <br>For that matter, it took him several minutes just to find the kitchen. <i>This is worse than trying to navigate Kyrian&#x2019;s mansion</i>. At least there, he had Rosa to ask for directions whenever he got lost. <br>Eyes wide, Nick hesitated in the doorway as he saw Bubba at the table, reading <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> while his mom cleaned up the griddle that was part of their massive gas stove. That thing alone looked like something out of an alien movie. <br>He&#x2019;d never seen a more normal morning scene in his life. And that scared the bejeezus out of him. <br>She glanced over to him and smiled. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s my favorite Boo. You feeling better, baby?&#x201d; <br>Hardly&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Sure, Ma.&#x201d; <br>Bubba checked his watch. &#x201c;You better grab it to go. I don&#x2019;t want to have to talk to Mr. Hutchins again about your tardies.&#x201d; <br>Nick scowled at the unfamiliar name. &#x201c;Mr. Hutchins?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Principal.&#x201d; Bubba folded the paper up and placed it on the table. <br>Nick was even more confused than before. &#x201c;When did St. Richard&#x2019;s get another principal? What happened to Mr. Head?&#x201d; Did zombies eat him, too? <br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s Mr. Head?&#x201d; his mom asked. <br>Nick stopped while he was way behind. At least until he caught sight of the date on the newspaper by Bubba&#x2019;s hand. His heart stopped. No flippin&#x2019; way. It had to be wrong. &#x201c;April 22, 2002? Is this a fake paper?&#x201d; <br>Bubba frowned at him. &#x201c;Maybe we should take you to a doctor.&#x201d; <br>That was all he needed. A visit to a psych ward. &#x201c;No, I&#x2019;m fine. Really.&#x201d; <br>Discreetly, Nick pulled out his license and checked his date of birth. His stomach hit the ground. If that was right, he was still sixteen, but that wasn&#x2019;t the right birth year for <i>him</i>. <br>Everything here was wrong. <br> <i>How is this possible? How?</i> <br>&#x201c;I better get to school,&#x201d; Nick breathed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my backpack?&#x201d; <br>His mom ruffled his hair. &#x201c;I think you left it in your car.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The Jag?&#x201d; <br>Bubba burst out laughing. &#x201c;You wish. I&#x2019;m not letting you drive the Jag until you&#x2019;re eighteen, buddy. It&#x2019;s in your Jeep.&#x201d; <br> <i>Okay, go with it</i>. <i>Don&#x2019;t react.</i> <br> <i>All is right in my world.</i> <br>Yeah, right. Nothing about any of this was right or normal. Which, given his royally screwed-up life, said a lot. He wanted to scream until it went back to the way it was supposed to be. <br>His mom brought the keys to him and held her hand to his forehead again. &#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re all right?&#x201d; <br>Better a lie than a straightjacket. &#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Michael&nbsp;&#x2026; I&#x2019;m thinking we might need to take him to a doctor.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sweetheart, you&#x2019;ve got to quit babying him so. He&#x2019;s a man with a job. He says he&#x2019;s fine. He&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; <br>Nick arched a brow at that. Could he still be working for Kyrian or Liza in this place? If Kyrian was around, he might be able to help. Surely a two-thousand-year-old immortal warrior who&#x2019;d sold his soul to a goddess would know something about alternate realities. For that matter, Nick might be able to borrow Kyrian&#x2019;s ring and summon the Greek goddess Artemis himself and get some long overdue answers. <br>His mother bit her bottom lip as she brushed her hand through Nick&#x2019;s hair. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s still my baby.&#x201d; <br>Grateful that hadn&#x2019;t changed, Nick gave her a quick hug before he headed for the front of the house. <br>Bubba cleared his throat. &#x201c;Where are you going, son?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;The curb.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Why? Your Jeep&#x2019;s in the garage.&#x201d; <br>They had a garage? <br>Nick looked up at the ornate crown molding in this expensive house. Of course they had a garage.&#x2026; <br>&#x201c;Oh. Okay.&#x201d; He headed in the opposite direction. <br>With a slight hesitation, he opened the door that he assumed was the garage only to find himself in the pantry. <br>Crap. <br>&#x201c;Um&nbsp;&#x2026; grabbing some Pop-Tarts for the road,&#x201d; Nick said, covering his mistake. Still, they both stared at him as if he&#x2019;d escaped Arkham Asylum. Offering them a fake smile, he grabbed the pastries, crossed himself, and hoped he got the next door correct. <br>Nope. Bathroom. <br>With a pain-filled groan at his rampant stupidity, Nick pretended to use it before he tried again. At least there were only two more doors to go. <br>Fifty-fifty chance. <br>Thankfully, third time was the charm. He let out a relieved breath as he stepped down and saw a red Jeep, black SUV, and silver Jaguar in the three-car garage. Man, that was so wrong. That Jag was the same car Acheron had given him when he&#x2019;d brought Nick&#x2019;s license over to their condo. <br> <i>I want the life back where I get to drive</i> that <i>without Bubba flipping out on me.</i> <br>Then again&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>This <i>was</i> a normal life. <i>Really</i> normal, like other people&#x2019;s lives. No one was trying to kill him, or eat him. He didn&#x2019;t have a principal who thought he was the biggest loser on the planet. Half the football team wasn&#x2019;t turning into zombies or werewolves. There was no psycho-demon coach threatening him if he didn&#x2019;t help kill his fellow teammates. Bubba and Mark weren&#x2019;t cattle-prod-wielding lunatics. <br> <i>You know, this has possibilities.</i> It might not be bad to be normal for a while. Weird and poor hadn&#x2019;t worked out that well for him. Rich and well dressed might be another story. <br>Feeling better about it all, Nick decided he&#x2019;d stop complaining about everything and just try this life on for a while. It might suit him. <br>After climbing into his Jeep, he made his way to school, where no one stared at him as if he&#x2019;d just run over their dog. In fact, it was disturbing how little attention he garnered. No one seemed to care at all that he was here. <br> <i>I could get used to this.</i> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Nick.&#x201d; <br>It took him a second to realize it was Caleb&nbsp;&#x2026; Fingerman, not Malphas, who was walking up to him in the hallway. <br>&#x201c;Hi, Caleb.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Feeling any better?&#x201d; <br>He scowled at Caleb&#x2019;s question. &#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I called to check on you, but your dad said you didn&#x2019;t feel well. That you went to bed as soon as you got home, without saying a word to anyone.&#x201d; <br>Yes, he had. After stumbling through the mansion and finding his room, he&#x2019;d been hoping it was all a bad dream and that he&#x2019;d wake up at home. <br>Bust on that thought. <br>&#x201c;Yeah. I think it was just a bug.&#x201d; Nick headed for his locker. As he tried to open it, the larger and snottier Madaug grabbed him and snatched him back. <br>&#x201c;What are you doing, buttmunch? You trying to put a love letter in my locker or something?&#x201d; <br>Nick shrugged his hold off. &#x201c;I was going to my locker.&#x201d; <br>Madaug shoved him across the hall. &#x201c;Yours is over there, doof. How many paint chips did you eat for breakfast?&#x201d; <br>Scowling, Nick met Caleb&#x2019;s concerned gaze. <br>&#x201c;Are you sure you&#x2019;re okay?&#x201d; <br>Nick returned his backpack to his shoulder. &#x201c;Can you keep a secret?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Always.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I think I have amnesia.&#x201d; <br>Caleb&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;From what?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Being slammed into lockers by dung-sniffing Neanderthals.&#x201d; Nick passed an evil glare at Madaug as he walked past them. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t seem to remember anything. Like, where&#x2019;s my first class?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Did you tell your parents?&#x201d; <br>Nick shook his head. &#x201c;You know how my mom is. I don&#x2019;t want to go to the Mayo Clinic for a hangnail. I feel fine. I just can&#x2019;t remember anything.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not fine, Nick. That&#x2019;s a big problem.&#x201d; <br>Yes, it was. But not for the reasons Caleb was thinking. &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t tell anyone, Caleb.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right. I&#x2019;ll help, but if it doesn&#x2019;t get better, you really need to have it checked out.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I will.&#x201d; <br>Caleb showed him to his locker and then opened it after Nick couldn&#x2019;t. &#x201c;The combo is your dad&#x2019;s jersey number, your mom&#x2019;s birth year, and the year your dad&#x2019;s team won the Super Bowl.&#x201d; <br>He arched a brow at Caleb&#x2019;s dissertation. &#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; <br>Caleb shrugged. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been best friends since birth. There&#x2019;s nothing about you I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>Yeah, right.

Witherup, SS</h2><p>A decade after the untimely death of renowned Scripture scholar Father Raymond E. Brown, SS, he continues to inspire and inform scholars and preachers, students and pastoral ministers, lay and ordained. It was only days after Father Brown&#x2019;s death that his final book was published by Liturgical Press. That book, Christ in the Gospels of the Ordinary Sundays, completed his six-volume series on preaching the Scriptures, a series that had begun in the mid-1970s with the publication of his popular An Adult Christ at Christmas. Those six volumes are collected here in one convenient commemorative edition to mark the tenth anniversary of Brown&#x2019;s death. Brown&#x2019;s work is left largely untouched, and readers will find that his wisdom is lasting. Yet Brown, being a scholar&#x2019;s scholar, would recognize the need for some enhancement in a work being republished some thirty years after the first volume appeared. Appropriately, then, this edition contains introductory essays by Brown&#x2019;s colleagues and friends John R. Donahue, SJ, and Ronald D. Witherup, SS, as well as useful indexes and a bibliography of resources for preaching the word of God in the context of the lectionary.</p><p><p>Ronald D. Witherup, PSS, is superior general of the Sulpicians, an order of diocesan priests dedicated to initial and ongoing formation of priests. He holds a doctorate in biblical studies and is the author of numerous books and articles on Scripture, including <i>The Word of God at Vatican II: Exploring Dei Verbum</i>, and <i>Biblical Fundamentalism, What Every Catholic Should Know</i>, published by Liturgical Press. He is also a contributor to <i>Give Us This Day</i>.</p>The individual chapters are very helpful if read during the appropriate liturgical season. The volume is highly recommended for home purchase as well as for parish, college, and religious house libraries.Catholic Library World<br><br>My only wish is that the book had been issued in hardcover to better withstand the repeated use it will surely be put to for teaching and preaching.Trinity Seminary Review<br><br>Raymond Brown speaks with a monumental assurance, the fruit not merely of his knowledge of the texts but also of his life of faith. His book contains many insights of startling simplicity into the original meaning of those texts, as well as into the church&#x2019;s situation today. Many who think that they know the scriptures well will find themselves enriched by observations from this eminent, and much-lamented, scholar that will not have occurred to them. There is a profound wisdom here that comes from decades of living in and with the text of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures.The Way<br><br>This book takes time! The text demands time not for conceptual understanding. No, the text deserves time to be experienced as a collection of scholarly meditations on the person of Christ in the Sunday proclamation. One needs to &#x2018;ponder these things in the heart.&#x2019; Additionally, both the scholar and the preacher will benefit from reading the detailed notations. They do not distract from meditation.<i>Catholic Books Review</i><br><br>This book provides a wonderful introduction to Gospel exegesis for laity and is an invaluable tool for those whose task it is to break open the Word of God Sunday after Sunday to sometimes very diverse audiences.<i>Prairie Messenger</i><br><br>This is indeed a fitting tribute to the enduring contribution of a great Catholic biblical scholar and teacher.<i>The Bible Today</i><br><br>An ultimate compendium of Brown&#x2019;s work through the years.<i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>Fr. Raymond Brown&#x2019;s Christ in the Gospels of the Liturgical Year fills a significant void in Catholic publishing: a book that integrates study, spirituality, and applications in an accessible manner. Its issuance as a handy compendium is particularly timely given the Synod on Scripture and the growing prominence of lectio divina. Christ in the Gospels of the Liturgical Year makes an excellent companion to the liturgy of the hours or daily and Sunday missals. This compelling title is enjoyable as well as informative and inspiring, thereby keeping the pages turning. A fitting testimony to the enduring nature of Fr. Brown&#x2019;s work.Karl A.

The result is a unique book that presents a conversation that is both poetic and critical.<br><br>The dialogue crosses over from Spanish to English, from poetry to academic argumentation, and from art to science. Defining "true performance" as "that of our species on Earth: the way we cause suffering to others, the way we warm the atmosphere or cause others species to disappear,<i>Slow Down Fast, A Toda Raja</i> proposes a necessary method for decolonial liberation, which reveals the transformative power of art in search of "an ecology of the soul, the resplendence of our connectivity to each other and the cosmos.</p></p><p></p><h2>A. R. Ammons: Selected Poems: (American Poets Project #20)</h2><p>Meditative, comic, emotionally wrenching, steeped in both the natural world and the life of the mind, the poetry of A. R. Ammons is at once cosmic in scope and intimate in its moment-to-moment transformations. With his mastery of description and cadence, his roiling wit and fearless gaze, Ammons was a philosopher of the everyday who found surprise everywhere he looked. &#x201c;He is often witty, sometimes bawdy,&#x201d; writes editor David Lehman, &#x201c;on a perpetual quest to find forms capacious enough for an imagination intent on finding a place for everything.&#x201d;<br><br>A compound, in editor David Lehman&#x2019;s words, of &#x201c;wisdom, pathos, humor, mortal longing, and intimations of immortality,&#x201d; the work of A. R. Ammons is like nothing else in modern American poetry. Ammons&#x2019;s tireless formal invention and restless curiosity about every aspect of nature and of the mind are embodied in poetry that is effortlessly accessible and generous in its impulses. Whether spreading out in the long forms of&nbsp;<i>Tape for the Turn of the Year</i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<i>Garbage</i>, or honing his perceptions down to the extreme brevity of his shorter lyrics, he holds tight to his vision of the way &#x201c;all day / life itself is bending, / weaving, changing, / adapting, failing, / succeeding.&#x201d;<br><br>This new selection covering the whole range of Ammons&#x2019;s career offers a superb introduction to the pleasures and surprises of his work. His uncanny ability to balance wide-ranging abstract speculation with meticulous observation of natural phenomena, in poetry that encompasses moods of tragic pathos, low comedy, and seemingly casual profundity marks him as one of the preeminent figures in our recent literature.<br><br><b>About the American Poets Project</b><br>Elegantly designed in compact editions, printed on acid-free paper, and textually authoritative, the American Poets Project makes available the full range of the American poetic accomplishment, selected and introduced by today&#x2019;s most discerning poets and critics.</p><p><b>Archie Randolph Ammons </b>(1926-2001) twice won the National Book Award for poetry in a career that extended over five decades and more than two dozen published works.<br><br><b>David Lehman</b>&nbsp;has been the series editor of&nbsp;<i>The Best American Poetry</i>&nbsp;since its creation in 1988. His books of poetry include&nbsp;<i>New and Selected Poems</i>,&nbsp;<i>When a Woman Loves a Man</i>, and&nbsp;<i>The Daily Mirror</i>. He teaches in the New School graduate writing program in New York City.Ammons (1926-2001) was a difficult figure to pin down. While unassociated with any particular poetic school or group, he picked up threads from Whitman, Williams, Frost and Stevens, weaving them into poetry all his own: equal parts pastoral meditation, philosophical speculation and homespun resignation. In the process, he won nearly every honor a major American poet can. Now, in the first selection to present samplings from the whole of his oeuvre (which ranges from two-line lyrics to book-length sequences), we can survey the extent is his poetic powers. Speaking like an earthy philosopher, Ammons renders vivid portrayals of man's interaction with nature ("...seedheads crushed by tires/.../ so many seeds, and not one will make a/ tree"), yielding humbling metaphysical observations: "...wind doesn't whistle, brother! brother!" The same mischievously sobering sensibility offers clipped, humorous takes on interpersonal relations, as in the six word gem "Their Sex Life": "One failure on/ Top of Another". In this small volume-the 20th in The Library of America's American Poets Project series-Lehman, poet and editor of the annual Best American Poetry anthologies, succeeds in giving a sense of Ammons' range and major themes, while pointing the reader toward Ammons' original books, which deserve to be read from cover to cover.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

While the scientist may identify problems, it falls to the engineer to solve them. It is the inherent practicality of engineering, which takes into account structural, economic, environmental, and other factors that science often does not consider, that makes engineering vital to answering our most urgent concerns.<br><br>Henry Petroski takes us inside the research, development, and debates surrounding the most critical challenges of our time, exploring the feasibility of biofuels, the progress of battery-operated cars, and the question of nuclear power. He gives us an in-depth investigation of the various options for renewable energy&#x2014;among them solar, wind, tidal, and ethanol&#x2014;explaining the benefits and risks of each. Will windmills soon populate our landscape the way they did in previous centuries? Will synthetic trees, said to be more efficient at absorbing harmful carbon dioxide than real trees, soon dot our prairies? Will we construct a &#x201c;sunshade&#x201d; in outer space to protect ourselves from dangerous rays? In many cases, the technology already exists. What&#x2019;s needed is not so much invention as engineering.<br><br>Just as the great achievements of centuries past&#x2014;the steamship, the airplane, the moon landing&#x2014;once seemed beyond reach, the solutions to the twenty-first century&#x2019;s problems await only a similar coordination of science and engineering. Eloquently reasoned and written, <i>The Essential Engineer</i> identifies and illuminates these problems&#x2014;and, above all, sets out a course for putting ideas into action.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Henry Petroski on Science, Engineering, and Culture</strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Science is by its very nature global. In fact, it is galactic, even universal. This is because science deals with universal laws, like the law of gravity. No matter where on earth I jump, gravity will pull me down according to the single law of universal gravitation. And no matter where an apple falls, it falls toward the ground. We believe that it has always been so, regardless of culture.</p> <p>But this is not to say that practicing science is independent of culture. It is proper to speak of American science, as distinct from, say, Japanese science. Indeed, at least one Japanese scientist has taken note of the fact that his culture has yielded a paucity of Nobel laureates. This has been attributed to the deference that the Japanese culture expects of the young toward the elderly. Prize-winning scientific breakthroughs often depend on rebellion against the prevailing paradigm, not deference to it.</p> <p>At the same time, the Japanese excel in technological endeavors. Their automobiles and consumer electronics are admired and bought around the world. The disciplined Japanese culture is well suited to the mass manufacturing of excellently engineered and highly reliable products. Those products that are exported fit nicely into the target culture; those that are for home consumption are distinctly Japanese.</p> <p>So there appears to be a significant difference between science and engineering and how they relate to culture. A commonly cited difference between the two endeavors is that science seeks to understand what is, whereas engineering seeks to create what never was. It is wrong to describe engineering as mere applied science. There is some extra-scientific component to engineering, something often referred to as the creative or artistic component. The engineer designing a bridge does not deduce its form from scientific laws and mathematical equations. Rather, like a poem or a painting, the bridge is formed first in the engineer&#x2019;s mind&#x2019;s eye. It is only then that the hypothesized structure can be given a scientific or mathematical litmus test. In engineering, analysis follows synthesis--not the other way around. </p> <p>It is essential that the similarities and differences between science and engineering be kept in mind when identifying and attacking global problems. Scientists and engineers come from different technical cultures as surely as Americans and Japanese do from different social ones. <em>--Henry Petroski</em></p> <p>(Photo � Catherine Petroski)</p>Henry Petroski is the Aleksandar S.

Works from artists such as Diego Rivera (Mexico), Fernando Botero (Columbia), and Ram�n Frad� (Puerto Rico) are included.<br><br>Background information on the artist, the period, the medium, the technique, and the subject of the painting provide context for the art experience.</p><p>The &#34;Come Look with Me&#34; series was created by Gladys S. Blizzard, whose experiences as an art teacher and work as a curator of education at Bayly Art Museum at the University of Virginia served as the basis for this educational style.Like other Come Look with Me titles, this large-size volume, focused on Latin American art of the last two centuries, offers both&nbsp;art history and interactive exercises. Each spread features a clearly reproduced color artwork by a well-known artist such as Frida Kahlo or Xul Solar paired with brief text about the artist's life, techniques, favorite themes, and influences. Simple questions, accessible to a wide age range, appear in larger type at the top of each biography.&nbsp;Straightforward suggestions to help viewers study the contents of each image ("What kind of creature do you see in this painting?") mix with more imaginative queries ("If you were in this painting, what sounds could you hear?"). Readers may need help with political and cultural references, but the clear, approachable questions will easily guide&nbsp;them back to the experience of looking at and responding to each image. This attractive introduction to Latin American art and culture should attract plenty of browsers as well as young researchers.

Rhyming text and illustrations follow a mischievous old black fly through the alphabet as he has a very busy bad day landing where he should not be.</p><p><p><b>Jim Aylesworth </b>taught the first grade for more than twenty years.

He lives in Hinsdale, Illinois, with his wife. </p><p><b>Stephen Gammell </b>has illustrated many books for children. He won the Caldecott Medal for <i>Song and Dance Man</i>. Stephen Gammell lives in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>``Old black fly's been/buzzin' around...And he's had a very/busy bad day,'' begins this alphabetical litany of misdemeanors (``He frolicked on the Eggs/for the birthday cake./He licked up the Frosting,/ for goodness sake./Shoo fly!/Shoo fly!/Shooo''). Having troubled the entire household and ``lit on the List'' of groceries (all of which turn up elsewhere), the fly ``Zzzz'''s onto a table where he comes to a just end: the baby drops the cake on him. Aylesworth's buoyant, rhythmic verse provides inspiration for a wondrous evolution of Gammell's style. Framing the book in dramatic fly-black endpapers, he intensifies his trademark rainbow colors, laying them on a white ground in vibrant clouds, flinging them in ebullient splatters signifying the mess and confusion in the fly's wake, and counterpointing the impressionistic setting with precisely observed characters and details: an outraged cat, Gramma's wizened face, the hairy, red-eyed culprit.

Travis&#x2014;did not die under brilliant sunlight, defending their positions against hordes of Mexican infantry. Instead the Mexicans launched a predawn attack, surmounting the walls in darkness, forcing a wild melee inside the fort before many of its defenders had even awoken.<br><br>In this book, Dr. Tucker, after deep research into recently discovered Mexican accounts and the forensic evidence, informs us that the traditional myth of the Alamo is even more off-base: most of the Alamo&#x2019;s defenders died in breakouts from the fort, cut down by Santa Anna&#x2019;s cavalry that had been pre-positioned to intercept the escapees.<br><br>To be clear, a number of the Alamo&#x2019;s defenders hung on inside the fort, fighting back every way they could. Captain Dickinson, with cannon atop the chapel (in which his wife hid), fired repeatedly into the Mexican throng of enemy cavalry until he was finally cut down. The controversy on Crockett still remains, though the recently authenticated diary of the Mexican de la Pena offers evidence that he surrendered.<br><br>The most startling aspect of this book is that most of the Texans, in two gallantly led groups, broke out of the fort after the enemy had broken in, and the primary fights took place on the plain outside.

A native of St. Louis, Missouri, he has earned three degrees in American history, including a Ph.D. from St. Louis University in 1990. In 1993 his biography of Father John B. Bannon won the Douglas Southall Freeman Award for the best book in Southern history. For more than two decades, Dr. Tucker has been a military historian for the U.S. Air Force. He currently lives in the Washington, DC area.&#x201c;...an eye opening reappraisal of what really happened during the Alamo siege, final assault and aftermath...Tucker&#x2019;s well researched account dramatically rewrites long-accepted history and shatters some of the most cherished and enduring myths about the 1836 battle. &#x201c; (<i>Armchair General</i>)<br><br>"An interesting, detailed study. Recommended" (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Those convinced that the 1836 Alamo battle was a heroic last stand will hate this book. Readers open to new interpretations, however, will find compelling arguments within its well-researched pages. The author, a historian who has written or edited many books involving 19th-century military campaigns, believes the Alamo defenders were overwhelmed in a surprise night attack, not a daylight assault, and many of them died outside the fort while trying to escape through Mexican lines.&#x201d; (<i>Dallas Morning News</i>)<br><br>"provides long overdue corrections to the Alamo story, this should be read by scholars and lay people alike" (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Over the years, a few scholars and history buffs have indicated that some aspects of the Alamo story may not have occurred as commonly believed. Now military historian Tucker (Burnside's Bridge) has used letters and reports of Mexican officers written immediately after the skirmish to show that almost everything we know about the fight at the Alamo is a myth. He explains that what drew Americans to Texas was cheap land that could be used for plantations worked by slaves, indicating that the Texas independence movement was designed to preserve slavery in Texas against a Mexican government that wanted to abolish the institution. Tucker demonstrates that the battle of the Alamo was in reality a 20-minute predawn skirmish of no military significance, one that literally caught the militarily inexperienced and overconfident defenders asleep in their beds. When aroused, they resorted to their natural instincts and fled (hence the title here), only to be cut down by Mexican cavalry. VERDICT As Tucker provides long-overdue corrections to the Alamo story unknown to most readers, this should be read by scholars and lay readers alike. . . .&#x201d; (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Today, most people will have in their mind the 1960 film version of the battle in which John Wayne played Davy Crockett. . . . This has helped to promote the image of a fervent band of freedom fighters standing up to the Mexican dictator and inflicting huge casualties upon overwhelming forces in a gallant stand. In fact, as the author&#x2019;s carefully researched book proves, the defenders were panic-stricken and fleeing as Santa Anna&#x2019;s dawn attack swept over them in barely 20 minutes. . . . To a British reader, what is most striking is how much the &#x2018;race&#x2019; issue mattered then and apparently still does now. . . . The Texans of 1836 supported slavery and were to fight a bitter civil war a generation later over the issue, while Mexico had abolished it a dozen years earlier. Who was then the liberator?&#x201d; (<i>Military Illustrated</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Challenges conventional Alamo studies . . .&#x201d; (<i>Southwestern Historical Quarterly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;While it's long been known that some of the garrison attempted to escape as the Mexican infantry overran the improvised fortress, using long-overlooked Mexican and American evidence, including military reports, letters, and oral testimony, Tucker concludes that perhaps as many as half the dead may have been cut down by Mexican cavalry as they attempted to escape on foot. &#x201c; A work likely to stir much controversy in some circles, and a necessary read for anyone interested in the Texas war for independence.&#x201d; (<i>StrategyPage</i>)<br><br>"I disagree with many things in Exodus from the Alamo but it deserves a reading."

In <i>Ottoman Baroque</i>&#x2015;the first English-language book on the topic&#x2015;�nver R�stem provides a compelling reassessment of this building style and shows how between 1740 and 1800 the Ottomans consciously coopted European forms to craft a new, politically charged, and globally resonant image for their empire&#x2019;s capital.</p><p>R�stem reclaims the label &#x201c;Ottoman Baroque&#x201d; as a productive framework for exploring the connectedness of Istanbul&#x2019;s eighteenth-century buildings to other traditions of the period. Using a wealth of primary sources, he demonstrates that this architecture was in its own day lauded by Ottomans and foreigners alike for its fresh, cosmopolitan effect. Purposefully and creatively assimilated, the style&#x2019;s cross-cultural borrowings were combined with Byzantine references that asserted the Ottomans&#x2019; entitlement to the Classical artistic heritage of Europe. Such aesthetic rebranding was part of a larger endeavor to reaffirm the empire&#x2019;s power at a time of intensified East-West contact, taking its boldest shape in a series of imperial mosques built across the city as landmarks of a state-sponsored idiom.</p><p>Copiously illustrated and drawing on previously unpublished documents, <i>Ottoman Baroque</i> breaks new ground in our understanding of Islamic visual culture in the modern era and offers a persuasive counterpoint to Eurocentric accounts of global art history.</p></p><p><b>�nver R�stem </b>is assistant professor of Islamic art and architecture at Johns Hopkins University.&#x201c;In the first English-language book on the subject, Islamic-art historian �nver R�stem focuses on imperial mosques across Istanbul to reveal how the Ottomans harnessed the architectural language of the baroque for a renewed expression of power.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Apollo Magazine</b><br><br>&#x201c;�nver R�stem&#x2019;s book offers a highly original mapping of local and foreign perceptions of the Ottoman Baroque&#x2019;s aesthetic syncretism. By attending to the changing architectural ambitions of imperial mosque construction in the Ottoman capital, Istanbul, R�stem&#x2019;s study deftly navigates this period of robust artistic dialogue and cross-cultural transfer. Historiographically attuned, visually compelling, and thoughtfully written, this is a must-read for anyone engaged with the global Baroque.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Mary Roberts, author of <i>Istanbul Exchanges</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Ottoman Baroque</i> takes a reflective and fine-grained look at a major stylistic turn in Ottoman architecture that has previously been dismissed and misunderstood in modern scholarship. �nver R�stem boldly reclaims the topic with an alternative and highly original critical perspective.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Ahmet Ersoy, author of <i>Architecture and the Late Ottoman Historical Imaginary</i></b></p><h2>The Wise King: A Christian Prince, Muslim Spain, and the Birth of the Renaissance</h2><p><b>An illuminating biography of Alfonso X, the 13th-century philosopher-king whose affinity for Islamic culture left an indelible mark on Western civilization</b><br>"If I had been present at the Creation," the thirteenth-century Spanish philosopher-king Alfonso X is said to have stated, "Many faults in the universe would have been avoided." Known as <i>El Sabio</i>, "the Wise," Alfonso was renowned by friends and enemies alike for his sparkling intellect and extraordinary cultural achievements. In <i>The Wise King</i>, celebrated historian Simon R. Doubleday traces the story of the king's life and times, leading us deep into his emotional world and showing how his intense admiration for Spain's rich Islamic culture paved the way for the European Renaissance.<br><br> In 1252, when Alfonso replaced his more militaristic father on the throne of Castile and Le�n, the battle to reconquer Muslim territory on the Iberian Peninsula was raging fiercely. But even as he led his Christian soldiers onto the battlefield, Alfonso was seduced by the glories of Muslim Spain. His engagement with the Arabic-speaking culture of the South shaped his pursuit of astronomy, for which he was famed for centuries, and his profoundly humane vision of the world, which Dante, Petrarch, and later Italian humanists would inherit. A composer of lyric verses, and patron of works on board games, hunting, and the properties of stones, Alfonso is best known today for his <i>Cantigas de Santa Mar�a</i> (Songs of Holy Mary), which offer a remarkable window onto his world. His ongoing struggles as a king and as a man were distilled-in art, music, literature, and architecture-into something sublime that speaks to us powerfully across the centuries.<br><br> An intimate biography of the Spanish ruler in whom two cultures converged, <i>The Wise King</i> introduces readers to a Renaissance man before his time, whose creative energy in the face of personal turmoil and existential threats to his kingdom would transform the course of Western history.</p><p><b>Simon R.

Promoting culture and learning, moderating temper and greed, acting virtuously by example, even judiciously endorsing games and sex--these were the tasks that Alfonso assigned himself, even while he fulfilled the more traditional roles of warrior and defender of the faith. That he did all this not despite the very real proximity of a rival Islamic kingdom but precisely because of it is one of the most intriguing arguments of Doubleday's beautifully-written book."--<b>Lisa Abend, Madrid correspondent, <i>TIME magazine, and author of <i>The Sorcerer's Apprentices</i></i></b><br><br>"Cosmopolitan, learned, and deeply-cultured, Alfonso is proof that brightness shone in parts of Europe during what later became popularly, if unfairly,known as the Dark Ages.

I finally feel as if I&#x2019;ve done something important, something that deserves real attention. All my life I&#x2019;ve tried, done my best, but no one ever truly appreciated my efforts, really saw me for who and what I was.</p><p>I can say objectively, honestly, I did a good and efficient job on this new, important project, start to finish.</p><p>There were times during the weeks and weeks&#x2014;months really&#x2014;of planning, of selecting, of working out all the tiny details, I felt impatient, even annoyed with myself.</p><p>There were times I doubted, times I nearly lost my courage and my focus. It&#x2019;s too easy to become discouraged when no one values your skills and your efforts.</p><p>But I see now this time (and maybe it&#x2019;s been years in the developing really) was all worth it.</p><p>The time spent will be worth it again, as all that preparation and planning is done on all who come next.</p><p>Because I spent those weeks watching the target, learning her routine, made the effort to get into her building long before tonight, and made the investment in the very best equipment, practiced all the steps for hours, I have my first success.</p><p>My first weight on the scale toward balance. My first tribute, I suppose, in honor of my friend and partner.</p><p>That icy blonde bitch deserved to die.</p><p>Didn&#x2019;t Shakespeare say something about killing all the lawyers?

Outside the ad blimps manically touted the <i>AFTER CHRISTMAS BLOW-OUT SALES!</i> and street vendors hyped fake designer wrist units and knockoff handbags to throngs of tourists packed into the city for the holiday week.</p><p>Outside life went on. Inside the plush bedroom with all its color and style, it had stopped.</p><p>An enormous arrangement of white lilies and purple roses in a tall, mirrored vase on the pedestal centered in the wide window couldn&#x2019;t quite mask the smell of death. Instead the fragrance layered over it, sickly sweet.</p><p>On a bed big enough for six lay the body of a woman who&#x2019;d once been a stunner. Even now her meticulous style showed in the perfect coordination of silver lounging pants, silky lavender top, the perfectly manicured nails&#x2014;hands and feet&#x2014;with polish of dark purple on all ten digits.</p><p>Her heavily lashed eyes stared straight up to the ceiling, as if mildly puzzled.</p><p>A razor-thin, bone-deep wound circled her throat. Blood, now congealed, had spilled from that ugly curve to soil and spoil the soft gray bedding and mat in the fall of pale blond hair.</p><p>Her tongue sat in a faceted glass dish on the glossy nightstand beside the bed.</p><p>But the kicker, at least for Eve, was the message written on the wall above the thickly padded headboard, in precise block lettering, black against the gray.</p><p>FOR LIEUTENANT EVE DALLAS,</p><p>WITH GREAT ADMIRATION AND UNDERSTANDING.</p><p>HER LIFE WAS A LIE; HER DEATH OUR TRUTH.</p><p>SHE SHOWED YOU NO RESPECT, SPOKE ILL OF YOU, SOUGHT TO PROFIT BY UNDERMINING ALL YOU WORK FOR.</p><p>IT WAS MY PLEASURE AND HONOR TO BALANCE THE SCALES.</p><p>JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED.</p><p>YOUR TRUE AND LOYAL FRIEND.</p><p>Beside Eve, her partner, Detective Peabody, blew out a long breath. &#x201c;Holy shit, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>Whether or not Eve thought the same, she turned to the uniformed officer in the bedroom doorway. &#x201c;Who found her?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Her admin. The vic missed a dinner meeting last night, then didn&#x2019;t come in to work, where she had a morning meeting. So the admin, Cecil Haversham, came by. Nobody could reach her via &#x2019;link, she didn&#x2019;t answer the door. He had her codes and key pass&#x2014;stated he waters her plants and whatnot when she&#x2019;s out of town. Let himself in at about nine-fifteen, heard the bedroom screen on like it is now, and walked through until he found her. We got the nine-one-one at nine-nineteen, so the timing works.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where is he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Place has a dining area you can close off. We&#x2019;re sitting on him there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Keep sitting. I want the building&#x2019;s security discs, exterior, interior, and I want a canvass started, beginning with this floor.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He jutted his chin to the writing on the wall. &#x201c;You know the vic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had some dealings with her.&#x201d; To discourage any more questions, Eve turned away.</p><p>She and Peabody had sealed up on entering the apartment. She&#x2019;d turned on her recorder before stepping into the bedroom. Now she stood a moment, a tall, slim woman with short, tousled brown hair, with long-lidded eyes of gilded brown cop-flat in her angular face.</p><p>Yeah, they&#x2019;d had some dealings, she thought now, and she hadn&#x2019;t had a modicum of liking for the victim. But it appeared she and Peabody would be spending the last days of the year standing for the once-high-powered defense attorney who&#x2019;d had&#x2014;to Eve&#x2019;s mind&#x2014;the ethics of a rattlesnake.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s verify ID, Peabody, and keep every step of this strict on procedure.&#x201d;</p><p>With a nod, Peabody took off her pink leather coat&#x2014;Eve&#x2019;s Christmas gift&#x2014;set it carefully aside before she pulled her Identi-pad from her field kit. With her striped pink pom-pom hat still over her flip of dark hair, she approached the body. &#x201c;Victim is identified as Leanore Bastwick of this address.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Cause of death looks pretty straightforward. Strangulation, probably a wire garrote, but the ME will confirm. Get time of death.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Peabody dug into her field kit. She worked the gauges, angled, as she read Eve&#x2019;s unspoken order, so the record would pick up everything.</p><p>&#x201c;TOD eighteen-thirty-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No sign of struggle, no visible defensive wounds or other injuries. No sign, at a glance, of forced entry. The vic&#x2019;s fully dressed, and there&#x2019;s plenty of easily transported valuables sitting out. It doesn&#x2019;t read sexual assault or burglary. It reads straight murder.&#x201d;</p><p>Peabody lifted her gaze to the message on the wall. &#x201c;Literally reads.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Security discs may tell a different tale, but it looks like the vic opened the door&#x2014;someone she knew or thought she knew. Her killer disabled her&#x2014;note to ME to put priority on tox screens, check body for any marks from a stunner or pressure syringe&#x2014;or forced her back here. Places like this have excellent soundproofing, so she could have shouted for help, screamed, and it&#x2019;s not likely anyone heard. Windows are privacy screened.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No sign on her wrists, her ankles that the killer used restraints.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve approached the body now, examined the head, lifted it up, to check the back of the skull. &#x201c;No injuries that indicate blunt force trauma.&#x201d;</p><p>She reached into her own field kit for microgoggles, took a closer look. &#x201c;Abrasion, small contusion. Fell back, hit her head maybe. Disabled, drugged or stunned, either when she opened the door, or if she knew the killer, after he was inside. Back here, carrying her or forcing her. The bedding&#x2019;s not even mussed, the pillows are still stacked up behind her.&#x201d;</p><p>Lifting one of the hands, she examined the fingers, the nails, under the nails. &#x201c;Clean, no trace here, nothing to indicate she got a piece of her killer. You&#x2019;re going to struggle, if you can, when somebody garrotes you, so she couldn&#x2019;t struggle.&#x201d;</p><p>With the microgoggles still in place, Eve leaned over the crystal dish to examine the severed tongue. &#x201c;It looks pretty clean&#x2014;not jagged, not sawed. Probably a thin, sharp blade. Maybe a scalpel. Can&#x2019;t talk trash without your tongue,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t defend criminals if you can&#x2019;t talk. This was a little something extra, a symbol, a&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. token.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For you.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve studied the message, coated a layer of ice over that sick thought. &#x201c;Like I said, it reads that way. We butted heads over Jess Barrow a couple years back, and just before that when her partner was killed. She was a hard-ass, but she was mostly doing her job. Doing it as she saw it.&#x201d;</p><p>Turning from the body now, Eve walked over into a large and perfectly appointed dressing room. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s got an outfit set out here. Black dress, fancy shoes, underwear, and jewelry to go with it that looks like the real deal. Nothing disturbed. She&#x2019;d gotten out the wardrobe for her dinner meeting.&#x201d;</p><p>She moved from there into an elaborate master bath, all white and silver. More purple flowers&#x2014;must have been a favorite&#x2014;in a square vase of clear glass on the long white counter.</p><p>&#x201c;Towels on a warming rack, a robe on the hook by the shower, a glass of wine and some sort of face gunk set out on the counter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see a mask.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A facial mask,&#x201d; Peabody elaborated, patting her own cheeks. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s a really high-end brand. Since there&#x2019;s nothing else set out, it looks like maybe she&#x2019;d been about to give herself a facial, have some wine while it set, then take a shower, but she went to answer the door.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, good. She&#x2019;s prepping for the meeting&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll check her home office&#x2014;going to get clean and shiny, but somebody comes to the door.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve walked out as she continued. &#x201c;Nothing disturbed out here. Screen on in the bedroom&#x2014;a little company or entertainment while she gets ready for dinner. She&#x2019;s back there, in the bath or the dressing room when she gets the buzz.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Security on the main door,&#x201d; Peabody pointed out. &#x201c;Buzzed the killer in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The security feed should tell us. However he got inside the building, she answers the door.&#x201d;</p><p>She imagined it, Bastwick in her swanky at-home wear, going to the door. Look through the security peep first, check the monitor?</p><p>Why have good security if you didn&#x2019;t use it? Used it, Eve concluded, felt no threat. Opened the door.</p><p>&#x201c;He takes her down,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;Drags or carries her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or she took him back?&#x201d; Peabody suggested. &#x201c;A lover maybe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s got a meeting. She doesn&#x2019;t have time for sex. Not wearing sex clothes, no face enhancements. Could&#x2019;ve forced her back, but it doesn&#x2019;t feel like it. Nothing disturbed. Nothing out of place.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve paused there, went back in, studied Bastwick&#x2019;s feet, still cased in silvery slippers. &#x201c;No scuffs on the heels. She wasn&#x2019;t dragged.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Carried her, then.&#x201d; Peabody, lips pursed in her square face, gauged the distance from living area to bedroom. &#x201c;If he did take her down in here, it&#x2019;s a good distance to cart her. Why?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, why? No overt signs of sexual assault. Maybe he re-dressed her after, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Morris will tell us. Killer gets her onto the bed. No sign she was gagged, but the ME will check that, too. He kills her while she&#x2019;s still out or stunned. Quick, cuts out her tongue to prove a point, writes the message so I&#x2019;ll know what a favor he did for me, then gets out.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk to the admin, then review the discs. I want to go over this place before we call in the sweepers.&#x201d;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>Cecil Haversham looked like his name. Formal with a side of dapper. He wore his hair white, short, and Caesarean, which suited the natty, perfectly trimmed goatee. The center leg pleats on his stone-gray three-piece suit looked sharp enough to draw blood.</p><p>Distress emanated from him in apologetic waves as he sat on a curved-back chair at the side of the lipstick-red dining table with his hands neatly folded.</p><p>Eve nodded to the uniform to dismiss her, then rounded to the head of the table with Peabody taking the chair opposite their witness.</p><p>&#x201c;Mr. Haversham, I&#x2019;m Lieutenant Dallas, and this is Detective Peabody. I understand this is a difficult time for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s very disturbing.&#x201d; His voice carried the faintest whiff of British upper class, though Eve&#x2019;s quick run on him gave his birthplace as Toledo, Ohio.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you worked for Ms. Bastwick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly two years as her administrative assistant. Prior I served as Mr. Vance Collier&#x2019;s&#x2014;of Swan, Colbreck, Collier and Ives&#x2014;admin.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And how did you come into her employ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She offered me the position, at a considerable increase in salary and benefits. And I felt moving into criminal law from corporate and tax law would be&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. more stimulating.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As her admin, you&#x2019;d be privy to her case files, her clients, and her social engagements.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, of course. Ms. Bastwick is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. was a very busy woman, professionally and personally. Part of my duties is to arrange her schedule, keep her calendar, make certain her time was well managed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know of anyone who&#x2019;d wish Ms. Bastwick harm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As a criminal defense attorney, she made enemies, of course. Prosecuting attorneys, clients who felt she hadn&#x2019;t performed adequately&#x2014;which would be nonsense, of course&#x2014;and those individuals represented by the prosecution. Even some police.&#x201d;</p><p>He gave Eve a steady if slightly distressed look. &#x201c;It would be the nature of her work, you see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Does anyone stand out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been asking myself that as I sat here, digesting it all. There have been threats, of course. We keep a file, which I&#x2019;d be happy to have copied for you if the firm clears it. But nothing stands out in this way. In this tragic way. Ms. Bastwick always said that if nobody threatened her or called her&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unattractive names, she wasn&#x2019;t doing her job. I must say, Lieutenant, Detective, you must often find yourself in that same position. The work you do creates enemies, particularly, one would think, if you do it well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t argue there.&#x201d; Eve sat back. &#x201c;Take me through it. When did you become concerned about Ms. Bastwick, and what did you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I became concerned, very concerned, this morning. I arrive at the offices at eight-fifteen, routinely.

Selected from 10 of his collections including two posthumous manuscripts, but none are from Poemasclandestinos (1980). The vital force of the intimate, conversational Spanish challenges the translators. Introductory essays by Ernesto Cardenal, Claribel Alegr�ia, and Hardie St. Martin recommend work for the classroom and the general reader&#34;--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.</p><p><p>Roque Dalton Garc�a (San Salvador, El Salvador, 14 May 1935 &#x2013; Quezaltepeque, El Salvador, 10 May 1975) was a leftist Salvadoran poet and journalist. He is considered one of Latin America's most compelling poets. He wrote emotionally strong, sometimes sarcastic, and image-loaded works dealing with life, death, love, and politics.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Spanish</p><h2>Introduction to Precious Metals</h2><p>Creative work in the studio can benefit from an understanding of materials and processes, but too often the worlds of science and art are unable to share information. This book bridges the gap through clear language spoken by a metallurgist with several decades of teaching experience. Through hundreds of charts, tables, and graphs, the author explains the intricacies of work-hardening, annealing, and alloying. This is a serious book for people who understand the value of technical information.</p><p>Mark Grimwade holds degrees in Physics, Chemistry, Maths, and Metallurgical Quality Control. For more than two decades he was Senior Lecturer at the City of London Polytechnic, and it was there that he started teaching metallurgy to practicing studio metalsmiths. He has been a consultant to the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, the World Gold Council, and the Royal College of Art. He has written numerous technical papers in the field and given presentations at the prestigious Santa Fe Symposium in the US.For many people at the craft end of the jewellery industry goldsmiths, silversmiths, designer-makers and the like with little scientific background, the manufacture of jewellery in the precious metals is not always easy, especially when problems arise such as cracking, porosity and other defects. For many, Mark Grimwade s classic text, Introduction to the Precious Metals , published over 20 years ago in 1985 was groundbreaking in making the metallurgy of the precious metals easy to understand and accessible for the non-scientifically inclined and is still highly valued in the jewellery industry. Unfortunately, it has long been out of print and second-hand copies are much sought after. At last, Mark has written a new edition of his book, much expanded, refined and including the new jewellery metal, palladium as well as gold silver and platinum. This was one book that I opened and simply read to the end, absorbed and fascinated. Mark has a gift of being an excellent communicator and educator. He presents the complex metallurgy of the precious metals in a way that goldsmiths can easily comprehend and find easy to apply in the practical situation. As Eddie Bell, goldsmith and co-founder of the Santa Fe Symposium remarks in his preface to the book, If you re like me, you ll turn to it for the answer to a specific problem and soon find yourself reading further than you intended. I endorse that comment wholeheartedly! The book is 240 pages long and comprises 17 chapters. The first 3 take us through the basic properties of the precious metals physical, mechanical and chemical, whilst the 4th summarises their occurrence, extraction and refining. The author then launches into a basic understanding of alloying behaviour, followed by chapters on the principles of solidification and working &amp; annealing. Then follow chapters on silver, gold and the platinum group metals and their alloys, which are full of useful information. Practical chapters on melting, alloying and casting, working &amp; annealing practice, joining techniques, electroplating and allied processes follow and the book finishes with chapters on the use of powder metallurgy in jewellery manufacture, surface decoration techniques and, finally, one on assaying and hallmarking. All are eminently readable and informative. As readers of this review may note from the title, the book is presented in American English spelling, but that should not distract us from the strength of this excellent 2nd edition. I would commend it to all. At $35, it is affordable for individuals and will be well used, I m certain. It is also serves as a useful training aid for students, technicians and others in the jewellery business, including retailers.

Now the gormandizing, spectacularly mustachioed sleuth finds himself facing down his greatest fears in an explosive case involving the Indian and Pakistani mafias.<br> <br>When the elderly father of a top Pakistani cricketer playing in a new multimillion-dollar cricket league dies frothing at the mouth during a post-match dinner, it&#x2019;s not a simple case of Delhi Belly. His butter chicken has been poisoned. To solve the case, Puri must penetrate the region&#x2019;s organized crime, following a trail that leads deep into Pakistan&#x2014;the country in which many members of the P.I.&#x2019;s family were massacred during the 1947 partition of India. The last piece of the puzzle, however, turns up closer to home when Puri learns of the one person who can identify the killer. Unfortunately it is the one person in the world with whom he has sworn never to work: his Mummy-ji.<br> <br>With riotously entertaining prose, a boisterous cast of characters, and a pitch-perfect sense of place, Tarquin Hall has crafted a gripping whodunit that takes us deep into Indian history and society. He brings a hugely appealing culture to life with all its sights, sounds, smells, foods, and complexity. As the title implies, <i>The Case of the Deadly Butter Chicken</i> is a succulent read by a writer at the top of his game.</p><p>Tarquin Hall<b> </b>is a British author and journalist who has lived and worked throughout South Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.

He lives in Delhi with his wife, Indian-born journalist Anu Anand, and their son.The Case of the Deadly Butter Chicken One<p></p> <br>Stripped down to his undergarments and tweed Sandown cap, Vish Puri stepped onto his wife&#x2019;s old set of bathroom weighing scales. He watched with apprehension as the needle jerked violently to the right and settled on 200 pounds.<br> <br>&#x201c;By God,&#x201d; the detective muttered to himself. &#x201c;Two extra pounds are there. She is going to kill me&#x2014;certainly if not totally.&#x201d;<br> <br>He tried lifting one foot off the pressure pad and shifted his weight to see if it made a difference. It didn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, nothing for it,&#x201d; he said with a sigh, stepping back onto the floor.<br> <br>Puri checked that the bedroom door was locked, picked up the scales and turned them over. He removed the bottom panel, exposing the crude mechanism inside. Then he squeezed the pressure pad between his knees. When the needle reached 196, he jammed a wooden peg into one of the cogs.<br> <br>The scales could now register only one weight: 196 pounds.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hearties congratulations, Mr. Puri, saar!&#x201d; he told himself with a smile after double-checking his handiwork. &#x201c;Diet is coming along most splendidly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still, the detective knew that he&#x2019;d bought himself a week or two at the most. Eventually all the lapses of the past fortnight would catch up with him&#x2014;for &#x201c;lapses&#x201d; read numerous chicken frankies, five or six kathi rolls (he had been on a stakeout; what else was he supposed to eat?), and a significant portion of the Gymkhana Club Sunday brunch buffet (the Pinky Pinky pudding had been irresistible).<br> <br>He was going to have to lose at least a token amount of weight&#x2014;enough to keep Rumpi and that bloody Dr. Mohan off his back.<br> <br>Fortunately, he believed he had found the answer to his prayers: diet pills. According to a flyer that had been stuffed under the windshield wiper of his car, these promised &#x201c;miraculous and exceptional results!&#x201d;<br> <br>Puri fished out the flyer from his trouser pocket and read it again just to check that his eyes hadn&#x2019;t deceived him. &#x201c;Tired of being a big motu, but want to enjoy your gulab jamuns?&#x201d; he read. &#x201c;ZeroCal is the answer! It contains a special fiber that absorbs fat molecules and converts them into a form the human system doesn&#x2019;t absorb. So now you can carry on getting your just desserts!&#x201d;<br> <br>Puri chuckled to himself. &#x201c;Just desserts,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Very good.&#x201d;<br> <br>He stuffed the flyer back into his trouser pocket as footsteps sounded on the top of the stairs. They were accompanied by his wife&#x2019;s voice: &#x201c;Chubby? Are you ready? We had better get a move on, no? There are bound to be traffic snarls.&#x201d;<br> <br>The detective went to the door and opened it.<br> <br>&#x201c;What have you been doing in here?&#x201d; asked Rumpi as she entered the room. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me you were listening in on the servants again with one of your bugs. You know I don&#x2019;t like it when you do that, Chubby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just I was weighing myself, actually.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br> <br>Puri stepped gingerly back onto the scales, one foot at a time. They gave a creak, but the peg held.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hmm. One hundred and ninety-six pounds,&#x201d; she read. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve lost .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two pounds. It&#x2019;s something, at least. But so far I don&#x2019;t see any improvement.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked her husband up and down, scrutinizing his stomach, which bulged out beneath his cotton undershirt like a lumpy pillow.<br> <br>&#x201c;You still look .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, if anything I would say you&#x2019;ve got a little larger, Chubby.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Must be your eyesights, my dear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with my eyesight, I can assure you,&#x201d; said Rumpi, her voice thick with suspicion. &#x201c;I just hope you&#x2019;re keeping off those chicken frankies,&#x201d; she continued with a sigh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s for your own good, Chubby. Remember what happened to Rajiv Uncle.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ah, poor old Rajiv Uncle. Last month he&#x2019;d suffered a massive heart attack while at the wheel of his Mahindra Scorpio and taken out four feet of the central barricade of the Noida Expressway. The fact that he&#x2019;d been fifty-four, only a couple of years older than Puri, had not been lost on Rumpi or his three daughters. Mummy had seen fit to comment on it as well&#x2014;along with his three sisters-in-law, numerous aunties, and even a cheeky nephew or two. Indeed, given the great Indian family system in which everyone knows everyone else&#x2019;s business and everyone exercises the right to involve themselves and comment upon everyone else&#x2019;s affairs, the detective had recently found himself on the receiving end of a good deal of health-related advice. Most irritating of all had been the impromptu lecture from his seventeen-year-old niece, whose opinions on most things in life were informed by India&#x2019;s edition of Cosmo magazine.<br> <br>Age still trumped youth even in today&#x2019;s changing middle-class society, so he had been able to tell her to put a sock in it. But over his wife, he enjoyed no such advantage.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, my dear,&#x201d; he replied with a prodigious yawn. &#x201c;Now I had better get changed. You&#x2019;re right. It is getting late. And I would be making one stop along the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t tell me you&#x2019;re working, Chubby&#x2014;not today of all days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ten minutes is required, only.&#x201d;<br> <br>Puri escaped into the bathroom to attend to his handlebar moustache, which was looking limp after the rigorous shampoo and conditioning he&#x2019;d given it earlier. First, he groomed it with a special comb with fine metal teeth. Then he applied some Wacky Tacky wax, which he heated with a hair dryer so it became soft and pliable. And finally, he shaped it into a symmetrical handlebar, curling the ends.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pukka!&#x201d;<br> <br>He returned to the bedroom to find his wife sitting at her dresser, putting on her earrings. Her long, straight hair hung down her back over the blouse of her lustrous black and gold Banarasi sari.<br> <br>Puri went and stood behind her, placed his hands on her elegant shoulders and smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;Beautiful as the first day we met. More beautiful, in fact,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Rumpi smiled back at him in the mirror. &#x201c;Still quite the charmer, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Once a charmer, always charming,&#x201d; cooed the detective, and bent down and kissed the top of her head.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>A thick January fog had engulfed Delhi and its unstoppable suburbs overnight. And when the Puris set off for South Delhi at midday&#x2014;some eight hours before the murder&#x2014;mist still veiled the imposing glass and steel buildings along the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway. Bereft of the sunshine usually gleaming off their futuristic fa�ades, the beacons of the new India suddenly looked pale and subdued.<br> <br>It was still bitingly cold as well. Not freezing, it had to be said, but the short winter always found the vast majority of the capital&#x2019;s inhabitants woefully ill prepared. With no means to heat classrooms, the city&#x2019;s schools had been closed for the past week. &#x201c;Load shedding&#x201d; led to frequent blackouts. And the morning newspapers brought daily reports of a dozen or so deaths amongst the countless thousands living in Delhi&#x2019;s makeshift jhuggis.<br> <br>The languid figures Puri spotted through the fogged-up windows of his Ambassador, layered in chunky cotton sweaters, reminded him of Victorian polar explorers in the days before brightly colored, mass-produced puffer jackets and fleeces. He spotted security guards standing outside the gates of a call center huddled around an electric cooking ring, chins tucked on chests like disobedient boys sent to the naughty corner. Farther on, a gang of laborers breaking rocks in a ditch wore scarves wrapped over the tops of their heads and under their chins, lending them a strangely effeminate look despite the arduous nature of their task.<br> <br>Puri and Rumpi had spent yesterday afternoon volunteering at a local charity, distributing blankets to the city&#x2019;s poor. Many of those they&#x2019;d encountered had been visibly malnourished, making them especially vulnerable to the cold. The experience had served as a sharp reminder that for all the growth in the economy, for all the fanfare about dazzling GDP figures and IT this and that, there was still so much need and want. Upon returning home last night, Puri had felt moved to write a new letter to the most honorable editor of The Times of India, pointing out that it was the duty of the &#x201c;proper authorities&#x201d; to make improvements and the responsibility of &#x201c;ordinary citizens&#x201d; to hold them accountable.<br> <br>&#x201c;With so much of change coming to modern society, it is of the upmost importance and necessity, also, that we continue to uphold the role of dharma,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d written. &#x201c;Dharma has been the underlying concept of our civilization over so many of millennia. Let us not forget the meaning of the word itself. This most cherished and honored of words comes to us from the root &#x2018;dhr,&#x2019; meaning &#x2018;to hold, to bear, to carry.&#x2019; For both Chanakya, founder of the Maurya Empire, and our great emperor Ashoka, it meant &#x2018;law, virtue, ethics and truth.&#x2019; Let us abide by these most honorable of principles, and with them firmly set in our minds, let us remember our collected responsibility to others and one another also.&#x201d;<br> <br>His message was evidently lost on the city&#x2019;s drivers. Despite the poor visibility, cars and trucks sped up behind the Ambassador flashing their headlights and honking their horns, and wove through slower-moving traffic like getaway vehicles fleeing bank robberies. Cocky hatchbacks, their side mirrors folded inward, squeezed between other vehicles, making three lanes out of two. The occasional rusting three-wheeler suddenly came into view, puttering along in the fast lane.<br> <br>And sports cars rocketed past, vanishing instantaneously into the fog. Puri kept bracing himself, anticipating a screech of brakes and the boom of a high-speed impact, but they never came. Could this lack of carnage be attributed to divine providence? he wondered. Or had Indian drivers developed the heightened reflexes of demolition derby drivers given that they faced similar conditions? Certainly the police played no part in keeping the traffic moving safely. Puri didn&#x2019;t spot a single patrol car along the entire route. There weren&#x2019;t any hazard signs in place, either. And so it was with a sigh of relief that he greeted the exit sign for South Delhi and the Ambassador was delivered safely down the off-ramp. A broad carriageway carried the car past the gated communities of the super-elite, where the tops of luxury villas peeked over high walls ringed by security cameras. They passed a series of identical concrete &#x201c;overbridges,&#x201d; which held aloft the city&#x2019;s new flyovers, and soon reached the AIIMS spaghetti junction. The detective found it impossible to pass the installation-art steel &#x201c;sprouts&#x201d; growing from the embankment without making some disparaging comment, and today was no exception. &#x201c;If that is art, then my name is Charlie with a capital C!&#x201d; he said, becoming all the more vocal when Rumpi said that she quite liked them.<br> <br>She and Puri were still arguing, albeit good-naturedly, when the car turned into Laxmi Bai Nagar.<br> <br>&#x201c;Number four oblique B, H Block, Lane C, off Avenue B.&#x201d; He read the address from a text message he&#x2019;d been sent on his phone. &#x201c;Behind all-day milk stall.&#x201d;<br> <br>Handbrake, his driver, acknowledged these instructions with a &#x201c;Yes, Boss&#x201d; and promptly pulled over to ask for directions.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aaall daay milk staall kahan hai?&#x201d; he asked an auto rickshaw driver.<br> <br>&#x201c;What is this case you&#x2019;re working on, Chubby?&#x201d; asked Rumpi as they waited.<br> <br>She rarely inquired about Puri&#x2019;s work (and he in turn usually only told her about an investigation once it was over). However, on this occasion, she felt she had the right to know. It was a big day for her family, after all.<br> <br>&#x201c;You remember Satya Pal Bhalla?&#x201d; he replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;That tabla player?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, other one&#x2014;moustache fellow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh God, don&#x2019;t tell me.&#x201d; She moaned.<br> <br>Puri gave a knowing nod. &#x201c;Absolutely, my dear. A total weirdo, we can say. But he called this morning, only, in quite a panic. Seems he got looted.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was an oversimplification. But the detective had no intention of providing Rumpi with the details. The whole thing would sound ridiculous and she would insist on driving directly to their destination, the Kotla cricket stadium, where her nephew, Rohan, was due to play in one of the opening matches of the new, multi-billion-dollar cricket tournament, the ICT.<br> <br>To the detective, however, the case was as tantalizing as a jalebi to a fly. He&#x2019;d had to handle a lot of run-of-the-mill work in the past month or so&#x2014;a slew of bog-standard matrimonial investigations, a mundane credit card fraud, several death verifications for insurance companies.<br> <br>Worst of all, he&#x2019;d found himself helping that bloody Queenie Mehta of Golf Links prove that her upstairs tenant was eating nonvegetarian food when the lease strictly forbade the consumption of meat on the premises. It didn&#x2019;t help matters that from the start Puri had sympathized with the &#x201c;offender,&#x201d; nor that the investigation itself had been especially unchallenging. True, the tenant in question had been careful not to place any incriminating evidence in his garbage, disposing of the bones from his illicit meals outside his home. But after one of Most Private Investigators&#x2019; operatives had followed him to the butcher&#x2019;s and covertly videoed him buying a kilo of mutton, the case had been brought to a speedy conclusion.<br> <br>Was it any wonder that the attempt to cut off Satya Pal Bhalla&#x2019;s moustache, the longest in the world, had every cell in his detective brain tingling with anticipation?<br> <br>Who would have done such a thing? A rival for his title? Someone with a grudge? Anything was possible in Delhi these days, Puri reminded himself. With the city&#x2019;s population growing exponentially, corruption endemic, and the elite amassing fabulous wealth as well as adopting Western tastes and lifestyles, Indian crime was taking on ever-new facets.<br> <br>Just look at the story on the front page of today&#x2019;s paper. Six months ago, if the report was to be believed, an Indian hacker had accessed America&#x2019;s Pentagon computer system and downloaded dozens of top-secret files related to security in South Asia.<br> <br>A commentator in the same paper likened these times to the myth of Neelkanth, when the demons churned the ocean in search of Amrita, the nectar of immortality. What they created instead was poison, which had to be consumed by the god Shiva.<br> <br>From this legend came the Hindi saying &#x201c;Amrut pane se pehle Vish pinna padta hai.&#x201d; Roughly translated it means &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t have the sweet without the sour.&#x201d;<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Three wrong turns, a couple of U-turns and two more stops-to-ask-directions later, Handbrake pulled up outside the address. Puri&#x2019;s prospective client, Bhalla, lived in a three-story government-housing complex for babus and their families. There were dozens of such blocks in South Delhi, most of them built in the 1950s and &#x2019;60s. Architecturally uninspiring, painted in the same government-issue off-pink, and only distinguishable from one another by the letters and numbers stenciled on their fa�ades, they had become some of the most desirable addresses in the capital.

The society of medieval Europe developed a rich set of imaginative traditions about death and the afterlife, using the dead as a point of entry for thinking about the self, regeneration, and loss. These macabre preoccupations are evident in the widespread popularity of stories about the returned dead, who interacted with the living both as disembodied spirits and as living corpses or revenants. In <i>Afterlives</i>, Nancy Mandeville Caciola explores this extraordinary phenomenon of the living's relationship with the dead in Europe during the five hundred years after the year 1000. </p><p>Caciola considers both Christian and pagan beliefs, showing how certain traditions survived and evolved over time, and how attitudes both diverged and overlapped through different contexts and social strata. As she shows, the intersection of Christian eschatology with various pagan afterlife imaginings&#x2015;from the classical paganisms of the Mediterranean to the Germanic, Celtic, Slavic, and Scandinavian paganisms indigenous to northern Europe&#x2015;brought new cultural values about the dead into the Christian fold as Christianity spread across Europe. Indeed, the Church proved surprisingly open to these influences, absorbing new images of death and afterlife in unpredictable fashion. Over time, however, the persistence of regional cultures and beliefs would be counterbalanced by the effects of an increasingly centralized Church hierarchy. Through it all, one thing remained constant: the deep desire in medieval people to bring together the living and the dead into a single community enduring across the generations.</p></p><p><p>Nancy Mandeville Caciola is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego. She is the author of <i>Discerning Spirits: Divine and Demonic Possession in the Middle Ages</i>, also from Cornell.</p><p>"<i>Afterlives</i> ambitiously reconstructs the thought-worlds of medieval Europeans asthey pertained to human death and what followed. Reading a wide variety of narrative sources with the careful eye of a cultural anthropologist, Nancy Mandeville Caciola unearths beliefs about death, spirits, ghosts, and revenants that were decidedly pre-Christian in their origin. Having found these materials and brought them together, the author deftly explores the manner in which pre-Christian ideas about death might live in harmony with Christian ideas, differ from them, or be co-opted into Christian theology. Caciola correctly recognizes that ideas about death change slowly and with difficulty, and that a careful read of extant medieval texts will reveal survivals, adaptations, and reinterpretations of pre-Christian ideals. She thus expands the current literature with a rich addition on the interplay between learned theology and folklore. Beyond the questions of death and afterlife, Caciola's findings also have cultural implications for those who study possession, the medieval cult of the saints, and early modern witchcraft."</p> (Leigh Ann Craig, Virginia Commonwealth University, author of <i>Wandering Women and Holy Matrons: Women as Pilgrims in the Later Middle Ages</i>)<br><br><p>"<i>Afterlives</i> is a well-researched and well-written book about medieval experiences with the return of the dead and their interaction with the living. Nancy Mandeville Caciola takes a broad regional approach to such encounters, arguing for the existence of distinct northern European and Mediterranean traditions. In the Slavic and Scandinavian cultural tradition the afterlife takes place in an embodied state that can interact with the world of the living in both dangerous and productive manners. The Mediterranean model made reference to disembodied spirits seeking to maintain contact with the living. Caciola also looks at changing medical lore on death, which suggests the eventual triumph of an understanding of death as swift and definitive, thus setting the way for modern understandings of death that made revenants and ghosts 'an old-fashioned relic.'"</p> (Patrick J.

Visit him at SteveJenkinsBooks.com.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;This poetry picture book about patterns in nature has some spreads on which rhymes sing and artwork thrills&#x2014;and others that disappoint. The peacock page delights readers with a Jenkins collage at his feathery best and these clever lines: "If you should meet a peacock pair,/the male's the one with all the flair./The female, who is rather plain,/is dazzled by his patterned train." In the spread about symmetry in moths' wing patterns, the insects' furry bodies seem to pop from the paper, but the text's attempt to rhyme "eyes" with "side" and "spring" with "wings" doesn't measure up. A clever spiral poem on the topshell snail is accompanied by a surprisingly flat and listless illustration. Awkward scanning in the rhymes throughout will make the book especially hard to read aloud without practice. Jarring in a book that is scientific in tone despite its poetic format is the statement that sea stars "grow back an arm/if they get into scrapes,/for they take such great pride/in their bright, starry shapes." One or two simple facts about the habits of each animal are included in the end matter. For an excellent poetic book about nature by this duo, try <i>Birdsongs</i> (S &amp; S, 2007).&#x2014;<i>Ellen Heath, Easton Area Public Library, Easton, PA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Fierce barrages of heavy artillery fire rained down on the buildings surrounding them, killing and maiming hundreds of civilians. Marie was killed by a rocket which also blew hole in Paul's thigh big enough to put his hand through. Bleeding profusely, short of food and water, and in excruciating pain, Paul then endured five days of intense bombardment before being evacuated in a daring escape in which he rode a motorbike through a tunnel, crawled through enemy terrain, and finally scaled a 12-foot-high wall. <br><br>Astonishingly vivid, heart-stoppingly dramatic. and shot through with dark humor, in <i>Under the Wire </i>Paul Conroy shows what it means to a be a war reporter in the 21st century.

How are men and women different? How does being a male or a female affect us at work? What are the roles of husband and wife in marriage and parenting? What does Christianity have to do with any of these things? Sexual identity lies at the core of the crucial questions that everyone asks of life. Yet today those questions are harder and harder to answer. Traditions about the &#34;real man&#34; and the &#34;woman&#39;s place&#34; have been challenged. Scientists debate what nature actually dictates for male and female. And theologians engage in heated controversy over what the Bible really says about female submission and male headship. In this sane yet provocative book, an informed social scientist and committed Christian thinker braves a jungle of confusion to offer unusual insight on the part genes, culture and faith play in making us the men and women we are -- and ought to become.</p><p>How does being a male or female affect us at work?

The flowers in my front garden are thriving, and the pink of the begonias with the purple and white of the petunias creates a beautiful kaleidoscope of color that never fails to cheer me up.</i><br><br><i> The earth is giving off a rich, fertile fragrance and the vibrant greens of grass and leaves provide the perfect backdrop for Mother Nature's riot of color.</i><br><br> Shelby's dogs wove in and out between her legs as she clomped across the muddy and rutted field that was drying rapidly in the warm rays of the sun. For days on end, every time she had pulled aside the curtains in the morning, the windows had been streaming with rain and the skies dark with swiftly moving clouds. <i>Dear Reader, hardly auspicious weather for a wedding, don't you agree? </i> Everyone had been praying the storm would pass on, and it looked as if their prayers had finally been answered.<br><br> This wasn't the first wedding to be held at Love Blossom Farm-she and William "Wild Bill" McDonald had stood under the twisted branches of the old apple tree in the backyard and made their vows. She remembered the day so clearly-how could it have been so many years ago already?<br><br> She hadn't wanted a long gown-the wedding had been too informal for an elaborate organza or tulle creation. She'd found a pretty white eyelet tea-length dress with a fitted bodice and a full skirt. She'd worn it with an elbow-length veil and carried a basket of wildflowers.<br><br> She shook her head. No use thinking about the past-Bill was gone now and it was time for her to move on. Today was meant to be a joyous day-the day her best friend, Dr. Kelly Thacker, tied the knot with Dr. Seth Gregson.<br><br> Shelby headed toward the old red barn in the distance. It was faded from all the years of bright sun and strong wind and was listing slightly. It had taken a lot of work, but it had been transformed into the perfect spot for Kelly and Seth's reception. Kelly had had her heart set on a real country wedding, and Seth had paid to bring in electric generators and for a rough wood floor to be laid.<br><br> There was a rustling sound in a nearby clump of tall grass, and Jenkins, Shelby's West Highland white terrier, dove into its midst in pursuit of whatever small creature was trying to make its home there.<br><br> Shelby was relieved when Jenkins backed out of the long, waving grass, his mouth empty. She knew it was in his nature to go after mice, chipmunks, and the like, but she hated seeing anything so small and helpless killed.<br><br> Bitsy, a giant lumbering mastiff, had no interest in hunting and was lying in the sun, her pink tongue lolling out of her mouth and her eyes closed in the blissful warmth.<br><br> "Hey, Mom," Shelby's nine-year-old son, Billy Jr., called from the distance. "I've found a frog. Can I keep it? Please?"<br><br> Shelby smiled as she walked toward Billy. So far this spring, he'd brought home a turtle, which had promptly escaped; a wounded sparrow, which they had nursed back to health; a garter snake, which Shelby had made him take right back outside again; and a very frightened baby rabbit.<br><br> "Look how big he is." Billy held out his hands as Shelby reached him.<br><br> "He is very handsome. But don't you think we should let him go?"<br><br> A stubborn look came over Billy's face-one Shelby knew well. This was when he looked most like his late father.<br><br> "I really think we should let him go."<br><br> "But I've already named him. I'm going to call him Bob."<br><br> "That's nice, Billy, but where would we keep him? It's not fair to lock him up inside. He would be miserable. He belongs outside."<br><br> Billy opened his mouth, but before he could argue any further, Bob the frog squirmed out of his grasp and hopped briskly away.<br><br> "Awwww," Billy cried, looking after him.<br><br> "Come on," Shelby said. "You need to take a bath and get dressed for the wedding. You have an important job to do-you're the ring bearer."<br><br> Billy looked as if he was about to protest, but then he saw Shelby's face-she could put on a pretty decent stubborn expression herself-and gave in and started to run toward the house.<br><br> Shelby was about to follow when she heard a slobbering sound-the kind of noise Bitsy made when she was drinking out of her water bowl. She turned around to see Bitsy lapping up rainwater from an old rusted trough that was left over from when Shelby's parents used to raise dairy cows.<br><br> Shelby and Bill had taken over the farm when her parents decided to retire and tour the country in their secondhand RV. The cattle had been too much work for her after Bill died, so she'd leased most of the pasture to Jake Taylor, a dairy farmer who looked more like a movie star than a farmer.<br><br> Shelby now grew herbs and a variety of lettuces and heirloom tomatoes and other vegetables. She kept a kitchen garden that supplied her family with fresh produce in the summer and canned in the winter.<br><br> Bitsy had finished drinking, and after shaking vigorously and splattering drops of water thither and yon, she caught up with Jenkins and the two of them ran ahead of Shelby toward the farmhouse. Shelby gave a last look at the old trough-maybe she would clean it up and use it as a planter. When you lived on a farm, your motto was "Waste not, want not."<br><br> Shelby had her hands on the door handle when a dusty and dented green van pulled into the driveway. The doors opened and a number of people spilled out, putting Shelby in mind of one of those clown cars in the circus. She supposed this must be the band Kelly had arranged to play at the reception.<br><br> One woman and three men stood next to the van, looking around and talking quietly. An equally dusty Taurus came down the drive and pulled up in back of the van. The man that got out was older than the others, with thinning hair at the crown of his head. He was the only one of the five not wearing ripped and faded jeans, but rather a pair of neat khakis and a blue-and-white-striped oxford shirt with the sleeves rolled up his thick forearms.<br><br> Shelby recognized Travis Cooper, the band's front man, right away. He'd grown up in Lovett and made a name for himself by taking first place on the television show <i>America Can Sing</i>. He had long since left Lovett behind. He'd already been on a tour of the country, scored a record deal, and had more than one song playing on the radio. Peter, the band's guitarist, was Kelly's cousin, and he had convinced Travis to play at Kelly and Seth's wedding. Kelly had been thrilled when they said yes. She hadn't told Seth about it-only that she'd booked a band for the reception-and she was looking forward to surprising him.<br><br> Shelby wasn't sure which of the other men was Kelly's cousin-probably the one with hair the same reddish hue as Kelly's.<br><br> Shelby heard the door to the mudroom slam and turned around to see Bert, a longtime family friend and a second mother to Shelby, walking toward her, wiping her hands on her red-and-white-checked apron. Although Kelly's wedding was being catered, Bert was helping put together a few of Shelby's signature side dishes that Shelby had promised to make.<br><br> She stopped alongside Shelby, her eyes trained on Travis.<br><br> "That is a good-looking specimen of a man if I've ever seen one. Although sadly way too young for me. Just who is that long, tall drink of water?"<br><br> Shelby looked at Travis. Bert was right. It wasn't just his voice that had attracted his legions of fans. He was tall and slim with blond hair that flopped over his forehead and that he was continually pushing back. He was wearing a pair of well-worn jeans that were tight in all the right places and a snug T-shirt that made it obvious he spent plenty of time in the gym working out. No wonder women were attracted to him and threw love notes onto the stage at his concerts.<br><br> Shelby caught Bert looking at her with a peculiar expression on her face.<br><br> "What?" Shelby said.<br><br> "Nothing." Bert shook her head. "But don't you think he's attractive?"<br><br> "Yes," Shelby agreed. "But . . ."<br><br> Shelby already had enough men in her life. She'd been casually dating Matt Hudson, who owned the Lovett General Store, and then there was her neighbor Jake Taylor, who had made it more than plain that he was ready to ask her out anytime she gave the sign.<br><br> And then there was Frank. Frank was her brother-in-law, and he had made it very clear that he was in love with Shelby. Shelby thought she might be in love with him, too, but she wasn't sure whether that was because of who he was as a person or it was because he looked so much like her late husband.<br><br> "Who are all these people?" Bert said, shading her eyes with her hand as she looked at the group gathered in the driveway.<br><br> "The cute one with the blond hair is Travis Cooper." Shelby nodded in Travis's direction. He was leaning against the van, chugging from a bottle of designer water.<br><br> "Should I know who he is?" Bert said. "I can't keep up with everything that's going on these days." She sighed. "My grandkids call me an old coot."<br><br> "I don't know much more than you do," Shelby said. "Only that Travis is a local boy who came in first on that television show <i>America Can Sing</i>. And those must be his musicians. I think that girl sings with him sometimes." Shelby pointed to a slender girl in ripped jeans, a purple tank top, and enormous dangling earrings that looked like dream catchers. "Kelly wants to surprise Seth."<br><br> "Oh, good heavens," Bert exclaimed. "That's Debbie Coster's boy. I knew he looked familiar. What was his name? Robert-that's it. But they used to call him Butch." Bert snorted. "Travis Cooper, indeed."<br><br> "I guess he's reinvented himself. He's quite an up-and-coming star now."<br><br> Shelby watched as a young man with dark hair buzzed short and the tattoo of a guitar peeking out of the right sleeve of his T-shirt muscled a huge amplifier out of the van while Travis stood and watched.<br><br> The fellow looked around helplessly. "Where are we setting up, Travis?"<br><br> Shelby thought it was time she introduced herself.<br><br> "I'm Shelby McDonald." She held out her hand.<br><br> She waited for the usual joke about the fact that her last name was McDonald and she was a farmer, but no one said anything and she gave a sigh of relief.<br><br> "Cody Baldwin," the young man said in return. "I'd shake your hand, but . . ."<br><br> "You're fine," Shelby said. She pointed past the house. "The reception is back there in the barn." Shelby pointed to a far-off blur of red.<br><br> Cody stared into the distance with a look of dismay on his face. He shifted the amplifier in his arms, resting the edge on his hip.<br><br> "You can pull the van closer. That should make it easier to unload."<br><br> Cody smiled. "A lot easier."<br><br> He shot a dirty look over his shoulder at Travis, who continued to lean languidly against the van.<br><br> "There's a dirt path," Shelby said, pointing beyond the driveway. "You can see it's been worn into the ground. If you follow that, it will take you out to the barn, where you can set up."<br><br> Shelby glanced toward the house, hoping Billy had started to get ready. They had only one full bathroom and had to take turns.<br><br> "I can come and show you if you want," Shelby said when she saw the confused look on Cody's face.<br><br> "If you don't mind," Cody said.<br><br> Cody maneuvered the amplifier back into the van, and Travis, Cody, the girl, and the other man piled in. The older fellow got into his own car and started the engine. Shelby pointed toward the path, then followed behind the van as it jounced over the rutted ground toward the barn.<br><br> Cody, who was driving, stopped in front of the open barn doors.<br><br> "You can pull the van around back," Shelby said. "That way it will be out of sight of the guests when they arrive."<br><br> The double barn doors were folded back, and each was adorned with a wreath of baby's breath and ivy, wound with a pale pink ribbon tied in a bow. Shelby couldn't believe how the interior of the barn had been transformed. It was no longer a dusty, creaking structure with bags of feed stacked in the corner and rusty farm implements leaning against the wall, but the perfect spot for a cozy country wedding.<br><br> Kelly hadn't wanted anything too fancy. She and Shelby had pored over wedding magazines and Pinterest boards online, looking for ideas. Barn weddings were all the rage, it seemed, but most were very elaborate with chandeliers hung from the rafters, long white tablecloths, massive flower arrangements, and silver candelabras.<br><br> Instead, simple strings of white lights were looped from the rafters, and long wood trestle tables were set with white runners down their middles. Bouquets of colorful flowers had been set in mason jars, surrounded by squat white candles in antique birdcages that Kelly had scrounged from barn sales. An old-fashioned bright red-and-yellow popcorn machine stood in one corner and a cotton candy machine in the other.<br><br> Shelby was expecting the caterers to arrive any minute. They would be setting up industrial-sized grills outside the barn for barbecuing the chicken and ribs. Kelly had ordered gallons of potato salad, homemade coleslaw, and plenty of corn bread with honey to go along with the main course. Bert would help Shelby make several huge green salads with lettuce from Shelby's garden. And then, of course, there would be wedding cake and an ice cream sundae bar complete with whipped cream, hot fudge sauce, sprinkles, and maraschino cherries.<br><br> The musicians were busy dragging their equipment out of the van and into the barn, where a stage had been set up along one wall. Cody seemed to be doing most of the work and he didn't look too happy about it.<br><br> He called to Travis as he wrestled one of the large amplifiers out of the van. "Hey, give me a hand, would you?"<br><br> Travis was deep in an animated conversation with the girl in the purple top, who fussed with the ends of her hair, examining them up close and then putting several strands in her mouth.<br><br>Travis finally turned to Cody. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see I&#x2019;m busy,man? Ask Brian.&#x201d; He pointed toward the van, where the other man was fiddling with a tangle of black cords.<br><br>Cody muttered something under his breath and then struggled toward the open barn doors with the amplifier.<br><br>Shelby turned and was about to walk back toward the house when someone tapped her on the shoulder. It was the girl in the purple tank top.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Paislee Fields,&#x201d; she said, holding out her hand.<br><br>Up close, Shelby could see there was a faint smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and the tiniest chip in one of her front teeth, which overlapped slightly.<br><br>Shelby took her hand. &#x201c;Shelby McDonald.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I hate to bother you, but&#x201d;&#x2014; Paislee twisted a lock ofhair around her finger&#x2014;&#x201c;is there a bathroom somewhere nearby?&#x201d;<br><br>Shelby laughed. &#x201c;Sure. Follow me. We&#x2019;ve set up some portable toilets for the wedding.&#x201d;<br><br>Shelby led Paislee around to the other end of the barn.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you from?&#x201d; Shelby said as they walked.<br><br>&#x201c;From the other side of the state,&#x201d; Paislee said. &#x201c;Near Ann Arbor. My mother teaches economics at the University of Michigan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;re a Wolverines fan?&#x201d;<br><br>Paislee shrugged. &#x201c;Not really. I didn&#x2019;t go to college. My mother wasn&#x2019;t too happy about it.&#x201d; She nibbled the cuticle of her left thumb. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve always wanted to sing and be involved with music. I&#x2019;ve never wanted anything else. College would have been a waste, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps,&#x201d; Shelby said, searching for the most noncommittal rejoinder she could think of.<br><br>&#x201c;Here you go.&#x201d; Shelb...</p><h2>March: Book Two (Turtleback School &amp; Library Binding Edition)</h2><p>FOR USE IN SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLY.

As in the first book, Lewis attends Barack Obama's inauguration, flashing back to his life as a young man taking part in the fight that would make it possible for America to eventually elect its first black president. Lewis lays out his involvement with sit-ins and the freedom rides, as well as becoming chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and speaking at the March on Washington in 1963, where he urged the crowd to "complete the revolution." Graphic in every sense of the word, this memoir puts a human face on a struggle that many students will primarily know from textbooks. Lewis makes it clear that the movement was far from a uniform entity, with disagreements cropping up, some small, such as differing opinions about the wording in speeches, others more serious, including whether to respond to resistance passively or with violence. Visually stunning, the black-and-white illustrations convey the emotions of this turbulent time, from Lewis's fear and pain while in prison to Governor George Wallace's sneering indifference during his "Segregation forever" speech. Powell's use of light and dark is masterly, and the contrast between the joy of Obama's inauguration and the obstacles faced back in the 1960s is effective. This insider's view of the civil rights movement should be required reading for young and old; not to be missed.&#x2014;Mahnaz Dar, School Library Journal</p><h2>Finding Your Path in Lehi&#39;s Dream</h2><p>With every passing day, the unforgettable imagery in Lehi&#39;s dream becomes more real and more relevant.

Although his ideas about art and life were often at odds with those of his contemporaries, they prefigured the ascendance of minimalism. Reinhardt&#39;s interest in the Orient and in religion, his strong convictions about the value of abstraction, and his disgust with the commercialism of the art world are as fresh and valid today as they were when he first expressed them.</p><p>Rose in the introduction suggests that Reinhardt&#39;s ultimate value is as &#39;a prophet of the realization that high art can only endure as spiritual art.&#39; Well, maybe, but his copious writings are also exuberant, ironic, rancorous and parodistic and, as such, a marvelous commentary of the recent art world.<b>Barbara Rose</b> is the author of books on Joan Miro, Claes Oldenburg, Lee Krasner, and Ellsworth Kelly and has twice received the College Art Association's Mather Award for distinguished criticism.</p><h2>The Poems of T.

Alfred Prufrock." As well as the masterpieces, the edition contains the poems of Eliot&#x2019;s youth, which were rediscovered only decades later, others that circulated privately during his lifetime, and love poems from his final years, written for his wife Valerie Eliot. </p><p>Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a commentary that illuminates the imaginative life of each poem. Calling upon Eliot&#x2019;s critical writings, as well as his drafts, letters, and other original materials, they illustrate not only the breadth of Eliot&#x2019;s interests and the range of his writings, but how it was that the author of "Gerontion" came to write "Triumphal March" and then <i>Four Quartets</i>. Thanks to the family and friends who recognized Eliot&#x2019;s genius and preserved his writings from an early age, the archival record is exceptionally complete, enabling us to follow in unique detail the progress of a mind that never ceased exploring. </p><p>Following the collected and uncollected poems of the first volume, this second volume opens with the two books of verse of other kinds that Eliot issued: the children&#x2019;s verse of <i>Old Possum&#x2019;s Book of Practical Cats</i> and his translation of St.-John Perse&#x2019;s <i>Anabase</i>. This volume then gathers the verses Eliot contributed to the learnedly lighthearted exchanges of <i>Noctes Binanian�</i> and others for intimate friends or written off the cuff. Each of these sections has its own commentary. Finally, and pertaining to the entire edition, there is a comprehensive textual history that contains not only variants from all known drafts and the many printings but also extended passages amounting to hundreds of lines of compelling verse.</p><p>"I do not know for certain how much of my own mind he invented."&#x2015;William Empson</p></p><p><p>A monumental event in Eliot scholarship.</p><p><b>Thomas Stearns Eliot </b>was born in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1888.

Swanson delves into the life and paintings of this little-known classicist</li><li>An important reference for anyone with an interest in the late post-Renaissance painters</li><li>Contains beautiful full-color reproductions of almost all known works attributed to this immensely talented artist</li></ul>John William Godward was among the brightest stars of the late Graeco-Roman painters during classicism's twilight years. Some believe he equalled Alma-Tadema in his depiction of marble and flowers and Frederic Leighton in his depiction of drapery. However, his own reclusive nature, society's loss of interest in classical subject painting, aggressive modernist art and the efforts of his disapproving family conspired to plunge him into obscurity. <br><br>Godward's art was more than escapist; it was purposely beautiful in an age plunging headlong into atrocity. For Godward, art was not only an aesthetic exercise but also a form of therapy. Through these pictures he lived his self-contained life until melancholia, fed by ill health and increasing artistic criticism, overwhelmed his fantasy haven. A hapless victim of his own personality, unable to make his way in a hostile world, Godward ended it all. <br><br>Swanson's original edition of John William Godward introduced the life of a very private man who pushed the classical ideal further into the twentieth century than most would think possible. This revised edition contains the author's latest research - significant expansions to the text, as well as approximately 100 new pictures, many of which have only recently been attributed to Godward.</p><p>Vern G. Swanson was born in Central Point, Oregon, and studied at Brigham Young University and the University of Utah. By the time he began reading for his PhD at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, 1978, he had been researching John William Godward for two years. Swanson has been appraising, authenticating and cataloguing British and Continental classical paintings for auction houses worldwide since 1982. He has been Museum Director of Springville Museum of Art, Springville, Utah since 1980. He has written two books on Alma-Tadema and is the author of Hidden Treasures: Russian and Soviet Impressionism 1930-1970s, and co-author of Utah Painting and Sculpture. He has also written numerous booklets, catalogues, brochures and articles.</p><h2>The Passionate Olive: 101 Things to Do with Olive Oil</h2><p>For more than four thousand years, the olive tree has been a symbol of abundance, peace, and longevity.

I adore everything about it: the color, the feel, the taste, the texture, the variety, the mystique, the smell&#x2014;the possibilities. I think my love of olive oil must be hereditary. Ever since I was a child growing up in an Italian American family, olives and olive oil have fascinated me. I remember opening a can of olives, draining the liquid, and putting whole pitted olives on my fingers and popping them in my mouth sequentially and eating them with complete delight. I also reminisce about my early childhood friends being shocked at our family&#x2019;s use of olive oil instead of the vegetable oils used in their homes, and their surprised faces as I dipped bread into oil rather than spreading it with butter. Even then I was trying to convert people to the magical world of olive oil.<br><br>All of my ancestors came from the region of Liguria, an area of Italy known for its light, flavorful, and delicate oils. I remember savoring the exquisite tastes of my grandmothers&#x2019; cooking and hearing the stories about how my grandfathers saved money for several weeks to purchase the precious oil; it was a household priority and a staple and necessary for food as well as for many other practical things.<br><br>Throughout history there have been many people who have been completely amazed by the merits of olive oil. Although treating leprosy, massaging the skin of elephants, or boiling it to pour over castle walls onto attackers may not be counted among our current everyday uses for olive oil, its uses are not only infinite but also legendary. Homer was right when he named this precious oil liquid gold and sang praises to the olive tree in his epic poems.<br><br>While most people think of olive oil mainly as a culinary condiment, people of the ancient Mediterranean burned olive oil for illumination or applied it topically to the body. From ancient times to the present, people have used it for medicine, for magic, and as part of their everyday beauty rituals. Olive oil has always been more than a basic food to the people of the Mediterranean; it&#x2019;s been the Mediterranean&#x2019;s lifeblood and has illuminated history since the beginning of humanity.<br><br>Olive oil&#x2019;s mystical glow has been a magical ingredient in religious and spiritual rituals and a therapeutic resource to cure ailments and diseases. It was used to anoint kings (often poured directly on their heads), and it became a &#x201c;monarch&#x201d; itself when it became known as the king of all oils. In ancient Greece, athletes ritualistically smeared it all over their bodies before engaging in physical exercise, and winners were crowned with olive branch wreaths. In Rome, gladiators oiled their bodies as they prepared for competition. Celebrated physician and Father of Medicine Hippocrates recommended the use of olive oil for curing ulcers, cholera, and muscular pain. Drops were (and still are) trickled through holes in the tombs of saints to pay homage to them. Olive oil perhaps is the missing piece used in building one of the engineering wonders of the world, answering the question scholars have posed for centuries: What else could have helped ease the movement of the great stones to build the pyramids of Egypt?<br><br>The history of the olive culture mirrors the history of Western civilization. Although scholars disagree as to the actual specific location, the olive tree most likely originated in Asia Minor, probably in the Caucasus Mountains. What is known is that the first cultivated olive trees appeared around 6,000 BC in the area of Syria. They then spread to Crete, Palestine, and Israel. As much as precious petroleum oil is used as a basis for today&#x2019;s economy, back then the economy was based on the production and sale of grain, wine, and olive oil. As trading moved out into other regions, this commercial network spread the knowledge and cultivation to what is now Turkey, Cyprus, Egypt, and Greece.<br><br>By the seventh century BC, olive trees were well established in Greece. The olive tree was considered so sacred that legislation was written to prohibit the cutting down of one. Known as Solon&#x2019;s Olive Protection Law, and written by the statesman, Solon, the law stated that wrote that anyone who uprooted or destroyed an olive tree would be judged in court and, if found guilty, sentenced to death. In fact, the olive culture was so highly valued and the fruit from trees considered so sacred and revered that only chaste men and virgins were authorized to pick the fruit. (I wonder what kind of workforce we could gather today based on those stringent guidelines?)<br><br>The Romans planted olive groves and extended olive cultivation throughout their ever-growing empire. They improved oil-production techniques by inventing what was to be the prototype of the modern lever press. Populations conquered by the Romans were often ordered to pay taxes in the form of olive oil. Why, you may ask? As great consumers of oil, the Romans could not feed their own citizens with local oil output (a situation that still exists in Italy today). As documented in the Museo dell&#x2019;Olivo (the Carli Olive Tree Museum in Imperia, Italy), it has been estimated that adult citizens going to public gymnasiums used as much as 55 liters (14.3 gallons) of olive oil annually for personal hygiene, for consumption, as a lubricant, for lighting, for rituals, and as a medicament. That is a lot of olive oil!<br><br>The valuable oil played an important role in the development of the Mediterranean economy. Under Roman rule, the Mediterranean region was divided according to olive oil markets, and olive oil trading was as hot a commodity as was dot.com stock in its heyday. Two notable differences between the dot.com peak and the olive oil peak: First of all, according to the historian Pliny, by the first century AD, Rome had excellent oil that was sold &#x201c;at reasonable prices.&#x201d; Second, olive oil is a trend that has lasted.<br><br>Advanced ships were built for the purpose of transporting oils a great distance. Hispania (that portion of the Roman Empire encompassing most of present-day Spain and Portugal) was the largest supplier of this precious liquid, and their olive oils were considered the holy grail of oils and thought to have the finest quality. The oil was shipped in terra-cotta amphoras (large, two-handled jars with narrow necks). Often carrying up to seventy kilos of olive oil, these amphoras could be used only once for three major reasons: olive oil permeated the porous terra-cotta causing rancidity if used again; they often became damaged during the voyage; and cleaning and recycling of the amphoras was unprofitable. The number of discarded amphoras is staggering. In fact, there is a mountain in Rome called Mt. Testaccio&#x2014;forty-nine meters high and one kilometer wide&#x2014;that is made entirely of methodically broken, discarded, and stacked amphoras.<br><br>The citizens of Rome and other parts of this vast empire consumed great quantities of Hispania&#x2019;s wonderful oil. Even the oldest cookbook (that we know about), written by Apicius in the first century AD and entitled De Re Coquinaria (&#x201c;On Cookery&#x201d;), included many recipes using Hispania&#x2019;s oil.<br><br>Olive cultivation declined during the barbarian invasions. It became rare and valuable during the Middle Ages, where it was chiefly used for religious purposes. Religious orders owned a great share of the cultivated olive trees, and behind monastic walls the precious oil could be found at the tables of churchmen.<br><br>The history of olive cultivation in the New World can be traced to missionaries traveling with Spanish explorers and conquistadors who carried the olive to Mexico (New Spain), to Caribbean settlements, then to the mainland of South America (Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile), and, at last, to what is now California. As early as 1524, Franciscan missionaries planted olive trees in New Spain. As they prepared for new settlements (in Baja California), they would take pot cuttings (or seeds) from existing orchards to their new outposts.<br><br>Sailing in the name of Spain, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus, while not involved in olive agriculture, noted the importance of olive oil during his journey to the New World. He is said to have allotted a daily ration of a quarter liter of olive oil (about 1 cup) to each sailor aboard ship.<br><br>The early history of olive cultivation in present-day California revolves around the Franciscan fathers. During the second half of the eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, olive groves were established at nineteen of the twenty-one California missions, beginning with San Diego de Alcala and ending with San Francisco Solano Mission in Sonoma. Only the missions at San Francisco and Carmel do not have suitable climates for growing olive trees.<br><br>Historically, the original purpose of growing olives in California was for the making of oil, with the first oil produced in 1803. By the mid-nineteenth century, olive oil was a thriving industry, but then it languished. Its popularity was cyclical, and, by the end of the nineteenth century, table olives became the primary products from the fruit of the tree (and still are). However, in recent years, a number of Californians are planting olive trees and harvesting the fruit to make exceptional olive oil.<br><br>Since 1985, the use of olive oil in the United States has grown exponentially with the importing of excellent European oils, the availability of award-winning California oils, the national focus on health and nutrition, and the growing interest in culinary arts. But not too many people know that the olive tree itself has always been a symbol of abundance, peace, longevity, and wisdom.<br><br>Capable of living up to three thousand years, this hardy and undemanding tree can survive semi-arid climates, shallow soil, and decapitation. Should a tree die, shoots will begin to grow from the base. Because of its immortal nature, the tree and the oil produced from it have developed magical auras and are referenced in numerous legends, stories, and myths.<br><br>Mythical, Mystical, and Legendary<br><br>The olive tree has inspired myths and legends and has enjoyed an unrivaled degree of fame (well, with perhaps the possible exception of the grapevine). It was especially lauded during the Greek, Egyptian, and Roman eras. In Greece, the history of olive oil is as old as the gods of Olympus. One Greek legend accounts for the very origin<br><br>of the olive and associates it with the founding of the city of Athens. According to the legend, a contest was held in Greece to see which god or goddess would be the patron of the new Greek city. Athena, goddess of wisdom, was challenged by Poseidon, god of the sea and horses, to provide the Greeks with the most useful, divine gift. Poseidon produced the horse; however, Athena was chosen by Zeus as the winner of the contest because she provided the most useful gift&#x2014;the olive tree&#x2014;noted for its oil, fruit, and wood and as the symbol of peace, wisdom, and prosperity. Even today, an olive tree stands where the story of this legendary competition is said to have taken place. The myth lives on; it is said that all the olive trees in Athens were descended from that first olive tree offered by Athena.<br><br>Throughout Greece, competitions were held in close connection with the olive tree. The Olympic Games, held in honor of Zeus, are where Olympic athletes (massaged with olive oil) believed that wisdom, power, and strength would be bestowed upon them. It was also believed that if one polished a statue of Zeus with olive oil, he would be so honored that he would bring the statue owner a long and happy life.<br><br>In Egypt, the kingdom that worshiped its pharaohs in life as well as death, crowns of olive branches were ritually offered and placed in tombs. Olive oil, mixed with sesame and pistachio oils, was applied prior to the linen wrapping of a mummy. The ancient Egyptians, who also used olive oil for cosmetics and medicine, believed the olive tree to be a gift from the gods that would bestow beauty, power, and love to its users. They also believed that Isis, goddess of fertility and wife of Osiris, a supreme god of the Egyptians, was responsible for teaching man how to extract oil from olives.<br><br>However, always competitive, the Romans credit the olive tree and its oil to their goddess of wisdom, technical skill, and invention&#x2014;Minerva&#x2014;who, according to legend, gave the Romans the art of cultivating the olive tree. The legendary founders of Rome&#x2014;the twins Romulus and Remus&#x2014;were believed to have been born under an olive tree. Another legend attributes the wild olive tree to Hercules, who struck the ground with his mighty club, which then took root. Whatever the legends, the civilized Romans, to this day, are credited with saying: &#x201c;Partes humani cultus necessariae vinum . . . atque oleum olivarum&#x201d;&#x2014;&#x201c;The necessary ingredients of civilization are wine and . . . olive oil.&#x201d;<br><br>Moses, Christ, and Muhammad Have One Thing in Common<br><br>Olive oil occupies a central place in all of the religions associated with the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The oil has been used for lamps in temples and for anointing rituals since time immemorial. Olive oil was sacred to Moses, Christ, and Muhammad.<br><br>Olive oil is referenced more than 140 times in the Bible, and the olive tree, considered the king of all trees, is mentioned over one hundred times. In Genesis, an olive branch was returned to Noah on the ark by a dove, signaling the end of the great flood. Since then, the olive branch has been viewed as a symbol of life and peace. The greatest religious significance of olive oil is documented in the book of Exodus, where the Lord tells Moses how to make an anointing oil of spices and olive oil. The olive tree and olive oil permeates different ancient psalms and prayers, many of which are recited today, including Psalm 23:5, &#x201c;. . . you anoint my head with oil.&#x201d;<br><br>For the Jewish people, having a plentiful supply of oil, along with wine, was a symbol of God&#x2019;s favor. Oil was, and still is, a sign of God&#x2019;s blessing because it represents all that is best in life and God&#x2019;s generosity to the people he loves.<br><br>In the Christian churches, both Western (Roman Catholic and Protestant) and Eastern (Orthodox), olive oil is the symbol of God&#x2019;s boundless generosity toward humankind and of his never-ending love. Christ (Christ�s) means the anointed one, that is, anointed with (olive) oil. When it is used to anoint people in church, it becomes one of the channels through which God&#x2019;s power comes into the world and by which he blesses Christians with his Holy Spirit.</p><h2>Lessons for the Professional Actor (PAJ Books)</h2><p>This volume collects the brilliant lectures which the great actor Michael Chekhov presented at his studio classes in New York in 1941.

Today there is a very rigid and regulated system and each big league club has an allotted number of teams at each level that they can have control over.<br> <br>Up until the 1950s this was not the norm. Some teams like the Cardinals and Dodgers had vast farm systems with outposts in almost every state. There was even a saying that went something like &#x201c;it ain&#x2019;t a town unless it&#x2019;s got a Cardinals farm team in it.&#x201d; These forgotten little towns and the teams that once played there are where the term bush league comes from, meaning far away from the bright lights of the major league cities.<br> <br>While the Cardinals and Dodgers had a continuous flow of new talent to fill their rosters, other teams were shortsighted or too cash-poor to have much of a farm system. The St. Louis Browns and Washington Senators fell into this category and their inability to develop fresh talent reflected in the two trading the position of last place in the American League year after year.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s always staggering to think that of the millions of players who pass through the ranks of the minor leagues, only a select few make it all the way to the big leagues. Take, for example, the year 1930: The National and American Leagues both consisted of eight teams each with 25 players on the roster. That&#x2019;s just 400 jobs available at the top level of the game. Now consider that every summer day in 1930 an estimated 4,000 players were playing their hearts out on 160 minor league teams, trying to make the big leagues. For every Hank Greenberg making a name for himself that year there were thousands of guys named Buckshot May and Pinky Pittenger toiling in obscurity for teams like the Des Moines Demons and Jersey City Skeeters.<br> <br>Everyone starts somewhere, and this chapter will show you how a few rose up from the anonymous thousands to become legends of the game.</p><h2>Never Kiss a Notorious Marquess: A Witty Victorian Historical Romance (The Infamous Lords)</h2><p><b><i>They are the infamous lords, whose scandalous ways keep tongues wagging.

Yet architects have neglected this area of practical construction in favor of historical, theoretical, and artistic analyses, resulting in the emergence of an influential building industry with architects on the far margins. Colin Davies explores in <i>The Prefabricated Home</i> how the relationship between architecture and industrialized building has now become an urgent issue for architects. <br><br><i>The Prefabricated Home</i> outlines the methods and motives of prefabricated buildings and assesses their architectural implications. Davies traces the origins of the branded building phenomenon with examples ranging from the Dymaxion bathroom to IKEA's "Bo Klok" house. He also analyzes the use of industrialized buildings worldwide&#x2014;including McDonald's drive-through restaurants and contrasts the aesthetic concerns of architects against the economic ones of industrialized building manufacturers. Ultimately, <i>The Prefabricated Home</i> proposes a partnership of architects and industrialized building that could potentially produce an exciting new type of humane and eco-conscious architecture. <br></p><p><b>Colin Davies</b> is professor in the Department of Architecture at the University of North London and the author of <i>High-tech Architecture</i>.<p>"An impassioned call to architects to change their attitudes to design processes, manufacturing methods and relationships with clients. . . <i>The Prefabricated Home</i> is a more complex and provocative book than it might at first appear.

Neither tribe had exercised their right to whale - in the case of the Makah, a right affirmed in their 1855 treaty with the federal government - since the gray whale had been hunted nearly to extinction by commercial whalers in the 1920s. The Makah whale hunt of 1999 was an event of international significance, connected to the worldwide struggle for aboriginal sovereignty and to the broader discourses of environmental sustainability, treaty rights, human rights, and animal rights.

Many books have been written about the boy king and his tomb, but this volume by world-renowned Egyptologist Zahi Hawass provides the reader with a unique perspective on this extraordinary archaeological find. Images by pioneering photographer Sandro Vannini offer distinctive views of almost 200 of the spectacular artifacts found at the burial site.</p><p><em>King Tutankhamun</em>&nbsp;uses carefully selected objects to illustrate the entire ten years of painstaking excavation and documentation carried out by Carter and his team. Organized to follow the chambers of the tomb in the order in which they were excavated, it illuminates the site&#x2019;s most magnificent artifacts.</p><p>An experienced field archaeologist who has made many important discoveries himself, Dr. Hawass imbues the text with his own unique voice, imagining how exploration of the tomb must have felt for Carter and providing invaluable information about the objects. Sandro Vannini&#x2019;s photographs are extraordinary as well, allowing the objects to be seen in even more detail than is possible with the naked eye.</p> 324 illustrations, 317 in color plus 26 foldouts</p><p><p><strong>Zahi Hawass</strong> has been secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egypt, and director of excavations at Giza, Saqqara, and the Bahariya Oasis. Over his career he has made many major archaeological discoveries, of which the most spectacular are the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza, the Valley of the Golden Mummies, and the identification of the mummy of Queen Hatshepsut.</p><p><strong>Sandro Vannini</strong> is an acclaimed Italian photographer who has worked closely with Zahi Hawass over the years.</p>The enthusiasm of archaeologist and prolific author Hawass radiates from this book. Hawass is the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, and he discovered the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza and identified the mummy of pharaoh Hatshepsut. His presentation of objects in this book follows the path of the tomb chambers in their order of excavation by Howard Carter. Hawass tells the story of the tomb's discovery as seen through the eyes of Carter and of the Egyptians who worked with him. Many of the 26 foldouts show top/bottom, front/back, and side images of objects pictured elsewhere from only one viewpoint. Although lavishly illustrated (featuring 324 color illustrations) with photographs by Vannini, who has contributed to many other archaeological volumes, this is no mere coffee-table book. Not to be outshone by the magnificent images, Hawass's text provides a history of the process of Carter's discovery.

From an early age, she knew that women were not given rights equal to men. But rather than accept her lesser status, Elizabeth went to college and later gathered other like-minded women to challenge the right to vote.Here is the inspiring story of an extraordinary woman who changed America forever because she wouldn't take "no" for an answer.</p><p><i>Elizabeth Leads the Way</i> is a 2009 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p><p>This title has Common Core connections.</p></p><p><p><b>TANYA LEE STONE </b>has written several books for young readers, including the young adult novel <i>A Bad Boy Can Be Good for a Girl</i>.

She studied illustration at the Royal College of Art, and lives in England.</p>Grade 1&#x2013;4&#x2014;Stone looks at the life of Stanton from childhood to her emergence as a pioneering leader of women's rights. The "strong-spirited, rule-breaking" girl asserted her independence by embracing physical and academic challenges and by questioning traditional viewpoints. This comes through in energetic, lucid prose that focuses on Elizabeth's ideas and feelings rather than on specific events. By consistently sticking to the subject's own experiences, without detours into historical details or even any dates, the author introduces a historical figure whom readers can relate to as a person. Excellent gouache and colored pencil illustrations, rendered in a lighthearted folk-art style, provide rich background for the brief text. They establish the time period through visual details and capture Stanton's spirit and the attitudes of those she encounters without overstatement. The book culminates with the event that propelled the woman into the national spotlight: her presentation at a convention in Seneca Falls, NY, in 1848, of the Declaration of Right and Sentiments, which included a call for women's voting rights. "Elizabeth had tossed a stone in the water and the ripples grew wider and wider and wider." An author's note briefly covers Stanton's subsequent accomplishments. Through words and pictures that work together and an emphasis on ideas and personality rather than factoids, this well-conceived introduction is just right for a young audience.&#x2014;<i>Steven Engelfried, Multnomah County Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

L. Ann Jervis here presents a convincing argument that human suffering is worth considering, and she offers the words of Paul as proof.<br><br> Paul's insights into the predicament and significance of suffering provide the foundation for some of Christianity's most profound and unique contributions to understanding human life. Examination of three of his letters -- Thessalonians, Philippians, and Romans -- reveals his important reflections on accepting the suffering of believers with the conviction that, even as we suffer, God's plan for creation does not include suffering, and God will ultimately banish it. As a result, believing sufferers are not victims of suffering.<br><br> Jervis hopes that hearing Paul's words on suffering in a fresh light may allow readers to be deeply marked, like the saints and shapers of Christianity, by the power of a gospel of which it is not necessary to be ashamed, precisely because it is not easy but transformative.</p><p>L Ann Jervis is Professor of New Testament at Wycliffe College and at Trinity College, both part of the Toronto School of Theology.</p><h2>Railroads and American Law</h2><p>No enterprise is so seductive as a railroad for the influence it exerts, the power it gives, and the hope of gain it offers.&#x2014;<i>Poor's Manual of Railroads</i> (1900 <br><br>At its peak, the railroad was the Internet of its day in its transformative impact on American life and law. A harbinger and promoter of economic empire, it was also the icon of a technological revolution that accelerated national expansion and in the process transformed our legal system. James W. Ely Jr., in the first comprehensive legal history of the rail industry, shows that the two institutions&#x2014;the railroad and American law&#x2014;had a profound influence on each other.<br><br>Ely chronicles how "America's first big business" impelled the creation of a vast array of new laws in a country where long-distance internal transport had previously been limited to canals and turnpikes. Railroads, the first major industry to experience extensive regulation, brought about significant legal innovations governing interstate commerce, eminent domain, private property, labor relations, and much more. Much of this development was originally designed to serve the interests of the railroads themselves but gradually came to contest and control the industry's power and exploitative tendencies.<br><br>As Ely reveals, despite its great promise and potential as an engine of prosperity and uniter of far-flung regions, the railroad was not universally admired. Railroads uprooted people, threatened local autonomy, and posed dangers to employees and the public alike&#x2014;situations with unprecedented legal ramifications. Ely explores the complex and sometimes contradictory ways in which those ramifications played out, as railroads crossed state lines and knitted together a diverse nation with thousands of miles of iron rail.<br><br>Epic in its scope, <i>Railroads and American Law</i> makes a complex subject accessible to a wide range of readers, from legal historians to railroad buffs, and shows the many ways in which a powerful industry brought change and innovation to America.</p><p>"A monumental achievement--it should be on the shelves of every railroad, economic, and legal historian."--Herbert Hovenkamp, author of <i>Enterprise and American Law, 1836-1937</i> <p>"Fills a large void in the field of legal history.

Fuller, 1888-1910</i>.</p><h2>A Book of Cape Cod Houses</h2><p>When anyone is asked to draw what they consider the quintessential American home, the result is usually a symmetrical, one and a half story structure, with a chimney in the middle, and windows on either side of a centrally placed front door. In other words, a Cape Cod house. From the mid-1600s to about 1850, Capes were built all across New England, homes to fishermen and farmers, to city dwellers and shipwrights. Their low-slung design meant they were economical, easy to build, and generally impervious to the bracing winds that swept in from the ocean. They could be enlarged by equally symmetrical wings, and if you couldn't afford clapboards all around, you could easily sheath the back and sides with inexpensive cedar shingles and let them weather to a stormy gray.<br><br>In short, these were the structures that worked their way into our native psyche and hearts. When the population exploded after World War II, Royal Barry Wills tweaked his blueprints and managed to adapt a basically 17th century design to the exigencies of 20th century living. It became the design of choice for the burgeoning suburbs, from the modest 720 square foot models of Levittown to the sprawling, expanded Capes of Concord.<br><br>What you will find in this classic book is the history of these homes accompanied by charming pencil drawings of floor plans, interior rooms, and entire houses. The text is readable, historically accurate, and, at least for our money, downright fascinating. Completely reset, finally available in paperback, and full of information, this book is as simple, elegant, and accessible as the houses it describes.</p><p></p><h2>No Longer Silent: The Empowerment of Women in the Gospels</h2><p>The story of Jesus of Nazareth has been called "the greatest story ever told," but what role do women play in that story? In No Longer Silent, author Susan Dehn Matthews attempts to highlight the women in the Gospels and provide the background behind those important women.<br><br>Matthews starts by noting that women in the Gospels were deliberately dis-empowered in order to maintain their presumed dependence, both in Scripture and in society. She then gives a voice to the minds and hearts of the women of the gospels who have been marginalized or ignored altogether. As she writes, "Each women whose story is recounted here is remarkable precisely because, through the power of an encounter with Jesus, she discovered within herself the Divine energy that allowed her to offer her unique gift to the world." Some of the women Matthews writes about include:<br><br> Elizabeth<br> Mary of Nazareth<br> Mary at the Wedding of Cana<br> The widowed mother of Nain<br> The woman accused<br> The mother of James and John<br> The sisters of Lazarus<br> The wife of Pilate<br> Mary Magdalene<br> Joanna</p><p>When I was asked to read Susan Dehn Matthews book, NO LONGER SILENT: The Empowerment of Women in the Gospels, I had no idea I would be embarking on a journey with a visionary and prophet. The trip is wild and wonderful, for those who wish to expand their comprehension of Scriptural vignettes beyond a literal translation and beyond a "reasonable" one. <br><br>It is equally exciting for anyone who desires to reach a new understanding of women in Scripture, one that is demanding of personal growth. In each of the 34 presentations, Matthews leads the reader into a new and different understanding of both the events she depicts and the participants whose lives are changed as a result of their responses to the divine call discovered in each unique situation. <br><br>Confining herself to selected women in the Gospels, Matthews has done a yeoman's work. She has achieved her goal as defined in the Afterword of the book. Through their encounters with Jesus in various roles, the women became more fully the persons God desired them to be. What is more important, "Each woman is an expression of some part of us as individuals." To paraphrase Matthews, the increase of our awareness of the Divine energy suffusing all creation will permit the stories in the book to become complete.<br><br>From conception to crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth becomes real as prophet, storyteller, teacher, healer, and Messiah within the feminine experience of life. This book is a tale of spiritual midwifery that relates specifically to women, but can easily be broadened to include the masculine understanding as well. It is the saga of humanity seeking freedom and justice, finding pain and passion while increasing one's capacity to love. It speaks of rejection and resentment, acceptance and understanding all within the human experience. It is a tribute to the Hebrew cry: "L'Chaim, to life!"<br><br>Especially intriguing were the selections from Scripture that did not identify gender, as in the centurion's slave and the couple traveling on the road to Emmaus. Matthews chooses to see them as women, thus giving a fresh aspect to the stories. She views the Martha/Mary story from the perspective of one who has a difficult time understanding another's choice of lifestyle. In so doing, she comes to a nuanced conclusion regarding Jesus' apparent admonishment regarding Martha's angst over Mary's option for the better part of life. Matthews sees both women as blessed by Jesus' words.<br>Reading this text heightened my desire to seek a group that would explore the stories, respond to the excellent questions that follow each vignette, and thus deepen life in God. An experienced facilitator could easily incorporate men in the study without diminishing the feminine contribution and, I believe, enhancing it.<br>While appreciating the need to note the empowerment of women in the Gospels, and thus to be empowered as women of the Gospel, it is good to allow men to understand a viewpoint that might not be theirs at the outset. Similarly, it would be a fine opportunity for literalists to broaden, no pun intended, their viewpoint.<br>Matthews heeded the Lucan command and did it well.

Some of them were mounted on the backs of handsome stallions, while others leaned forward with squared shoulders, ready to attack. In one swift motion, the men unsheathe their swords and raise it over their heads, their weapons winking as the glare of the sunlight bounces off the blade. <br>To the somewhat trained eye, these warriors in Norman-inspired gear would have appeared to be one of the Crusader forces, but it is that bold black cross painted across their chests and shields that give them away. These men were none other than the fabled Teutonic Knights. The knights of the Teutonic Order have since been compared to the surreal creature that appeared to the biblical Ezekiel, one that bore 2 faces &#x2013; one of a man's, and one of a lion's. The human side of the creature is said to symbolize the order's charity, whereas the lion was a metaphor for its valor and gallant spirit, which they relied on to vanquish the heathens of the world. <br>Like other secretive groups, the mystery surrounding the Teutonic Knights has helped their legacy endure. While some conspiracy theorists attempt to tie the group to other alleged secret societies like the Illuminati, other groups have tried to assert connections with the Teutonic Knights to bolster their own credentials. Who they were and what they had in their possession continue to be a source of great intrigue even among non-historical circles. <br>While the military orders are now often tied to religion or conspiracy theories, they did once wield great power and influence in Europe, and their actions had consequences centuries after they had reached their peak. This was made clear in the wake of a major battle fought between German and Russian forces from August 26-30, 1914 during the First World War. It occurred in Masuria, a region of marshes, woodland, and numerous lakes in northern Poland, almost 400,000 men were involved, and it was a decisive victory for the Germans, who annihilated the Russian army. The Germans named the battle after Tannenberg (Polish Stebark), and the battle, though widely fought over 100 miles, did indeed encompass the village, but there was a historical reason for assigning the name to the battle. On July 15, 1410, Tannenberg was the site of another decisive battle between the army of the Germanic Teutonic Order and that of Poland-Lithuania, a battle now commonly referred to as the Battle of Grunwald (after another nearby village). German nationalism saw the destruction of the Russians as vengeance upon the Slavs for the defeat of 1410, and the Nazis also exploited that sentiment during their invasions of Poland and Russia. Conversely, for Poles and Russians, the Teutonic Knights were precursors of the rapacious Germans of the Second and Third Reichs, and Grunwald was a symbol of freedom and resistance. These sentiments remain strong to this day. <br>These considerations aside, the Battle of Grunwald was significant for a number of reasons. It marked the end of the German colonization of Slavic and Baltic lands in northeastern Europe that had begun in the 12th century. It therefore also marked the beginning of an age when the Slavic (principally the Polish) peoples could grow and expand without interference from the West. The battle also signified the end of the Teutonic Knights as a major power and marked the rise of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.</p><p></p><h2>Small Twig Hiking &amp; Camping Guide: A Complete Introduction to the World of Hiking &amp; Camping for Small Twigs of All Ages</h2><p><p>&nbsp; Buck Wilder has ten books about nature and how we are connected to everything around us.

Looking at the cumulative effects of urban decline in the classic post-industrial city of Camden, New Jersey, historian Howard Gillette, Jr., probes the interaction of politics, economic restructuring, and racial bias to evaluate contemporary efforts at revitalization. In a sweeping analysis, Gillette identifies a number of related factors to explain this phenomenon, including the corrosive effects of concentrated poverty, environmental injustice, and a political bias that favors suburban amenity over urban reconstruction.</p><p>Challenging popular perceptions that poor people are responsible for the untenable living conditions in which they find themselves, Gillette reveals how the effects of political decisions made over the past half century have combined with structural inequities to sustain and prolong a city's impoverishment. Even the most admirable efforts to rebuild neighborhoods through community development and the reinvention of downtowns as tourist destinations are inadequate solutions, Gillette argues. He maintains that only a concerted regional planning response&#x2014;in which a city and suburbs cooperate&#x2014;is capable of achieving true revitalization. Though such a response is mandated in Camden as part of an unprecedented state intervention, its success is still not assured, given the legacy of outside antagonism to the city and its residents.</p><p>Deeply researched and forcefully argued, <i>Camden After the Fall</i> chronicles the history of the post-industrial American city and points toward a sustained urban revitalization strategy for the twenty-first century.</p></p><p>Howard Gillette, Jr., is Professor of History at Rutgers University and the author of Between Justice and Beauty: Race, Planning, and the Failure of Urban Policy in Washington, D.C, also available from the University of Pennsylvania Press.<p>"A fascinating and frequently eloquent exploration of the city's history since World War II."&#x2014;<i>Camden Courier Post</i></p><br><br><p>"A thorough, well-researched, and important book. Through a careful analysis of people and politics, Gillette challenges the accepted narrative of postwar urban decline. The story of Camden is of special consequence to urban historians, historians of late twentieth-century U.S. political economy, and students of contemporary urban policy. Gillette is certainly the person to tell that story."&#x2014;Robert Self, Brown University</p><br><br><p>"The best study so far about the virtual collapse in the late twentieth century of South Jersey's largest city."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></p><br><br><p>"With keen insight, Howard Gillette movingly details how de-industrialization, suburbanization, racial isolation, and political exploitation reduced Camden from industrial powerhouse to America's third poorest city. Through the rich biography of one city, Camden's fall could be the story of the half-century decline of many industrial cities and their struggles to revive, just more so. <i>Camden After the Fall</i> will become a classic in the field of urban history."&#x2014;David Rusk, author of <i>Inside Game/Outside Game: Winning Strategies for Saving Urban America</i></p><br><br><p>"A masterly narrative. . . .

And while some of the bravest people of the 20th century risked their lives for the right to simply order a cheeseburger, ride a bus, or use a clean water fountain, there was another virtually unheard of struggle&#x2014;this one for the right to read. Although illegal, racial segregation was strictly enforced in a number of American states, and public libraries were not immune. Numerous libraries were desegregated on paper only: there would be no cards given to African-Americans, no books for them read, and no furniture for them to use. <br><br>It was these exact conditions that helped create Freedom Libraries. Over eighty of these parallel libraries appeared in the Deep South, staffed by civil rights voter registration workers. While the grassroots nature of the libraries meant they varied in size and quality, all of them created the first encounter many African-Americans had with a library. Terror, bombings, and eventually murder would be visited on the Freedom Libraries&#x2014;with people giving up their lives so others could read a library book. <br><br>This book delves into how these libraries were the heart of the Civil Rights Movement, and the remarkable courage of the people who used them. They would forever change libraries and librarianship, even as they helped the greater movement change the society these libraries belonged to. Photographs of the libraries bring this little-known part of American history to life.</p><p>Born and raised in the shadow of the British Columbia Rocky Mountains, Mike Selby is a professional librarian. He received his MLIS from the University of Alabama, which is where he first unearthed the story of the Freedom Libraries. He is also a newspaper columnist, having published over 900 articles about libraries, reading, and print culture&#x2014;much of it covering libraries during the Civil Rights Movement. He has also had two peer-reviewed academic pieces published, both on this topic.Librarian Selby documents the history of Freedom Libraries, the unofficial public libraries that grew out of the Civil Rights movement. For the most part, these were set up in whatever space was available and managed by whichever volunteer was willing to take on the task. The books were donated and often totally unsuitable, so these volunteers had to sift through them to create an appropriate collection. The spaces were used for meetings and teaching spaces as well, and became an integral part of the Freedom Rider movement. The chapter on the Philadelphia Freedom Library shows that the north was not exempt from the failure to meet the needs of all of its Black citizens. This is a well-researched and documented history of an important aspect of the Civil Rights Movement. It should find a place in most collections. (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>Freedom Libraries tells the story of the powerful cultural/political thrust of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1960&#x2019;s. Black folks had been segregated out of public libraries for years. Civil Rights Movement folks installed libraries, called for book donations which came in from all over the country. It was wonderful to see children holding &amp; reading those books!! I was there and this book tells the story. (Denise Nicholas, critically acclaimed author of Freshwater Road, award winning actress, civil rights activist, public speaker)<br><br>In 1939 five African American men were arrested for reading silently in a Virginia public library. As Mike Selby convincingly shows, the story of American libraries encapsulates the heart of the Civil Rights Movement and the struggle for American democracy more broadly. Selby deftly marshals an array of sources to document the stories of the enterprising and brave Americans who insisted on library access during the terror and disparities of Jim Crow. The local African American communities who collaborated with black and white civil rights workers to build Freedom Libraries, despite the violent retributions of white authorities and communities, were often risking their lives to access books which were themselves propaganda to justify the regime of racial oppression. These never before compiled, finely detailed accounts shed further light on the profound malevolence of white supremacy - in word and deed - a disturbing part of our shared history that must be recognized, as well as chronicle the astonishing courage of those who challenged it that must be remembered.

This powerful novel shows her as she lived. SIX TUDOR QUEENS. SIX NOVELS. SIX YEARS.</p><p><b>Alison Weir</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the novels <i>Katherine of Aragon: The True Queen; The Marriage Game; A Dangerous Inheritance; Captive Queen; The Lady Elizabeth;</i> and <i>Innocent Traitor</i> and numerous historical biographies, including <i>The Lost Tudor Princess, Elizabeth of York, Mary Boleyn, The Lady in the Tower, Mistress of the Monarchy, Henry VIII, Eleanor of Aquitaine, The Life of Elizabeth I,</i> and <i>The Six Wives of Henry VIII.</i> She lives in Surrey, England, with her husband.Chapter 1<br><br>1512<br><br>Her skin was rather sallow, Anne thought as she studied herself in the silver mirror, and she had too many moles, but at least her face was a fashionable oval. At eleven she had no womanly figure to speak of, but that hopefully would change in the next year or so. Mary, after all, was already buxom at thirteen.<br><br>She drew back, considering herself. People had often said, within her hearing, that Mary was the more beautiful of the two Boleyn sisters. Yet they were both brunettes, with long glossy hair, high cheekbones and pointed chins, and both slender and graceful, for the deportment fit for royal courts had been drummed into them. So what was it that made a girl beautiful? What made the arrangement of Mary&#x2019;s features better than hers? It had begun to bother Anne, now that she was growing up and was constantly being enjoined to prepare herself for a glorious future in which royal favor and a wealthy husband of rank loomed large.<br><br>Maybe it was the moles and the sallow skin. The sallowness could be rectified by a lotion of powdered egg whites and alum. At least she had a pretty mouth, and the black eyes that her Grandmother Butler always said were her best feature.<br><br>&#x201c;And you know already how to use them for effect, child.&#x201d; Anne had not quite understood what that meant, but then Grandmother was Irish and a little fey and often said some startling things. Everyone tolerated it because she had been a great heiress and one of the chief sources of the family fortunes.<br><br>Anne propped up the mirror on a chest and twirled in front of it. She did look good in the green gown, which made her waist seem so slender. The dark color became her too. The only thing that was wrong was the cut of the sleeves, which were tight to the wrist and did not cover the deformity of which she was always so painfully aware. She was forever curling it into her palm, the little finger of her right hand, so that none should see the tiny extra nail. If only she could have a gown with hanging sleeves that would cover it! But Mother said it was foolish to worry about such a little thing. It was not a little thing to Anne, and it had loomed larger than ever since the day when Mary, bested in one of their interminable arguments, had called it a witch&#x2019;s mark.<br><br>Anne pushed the hateful memory aside. She would not dwell on it on this beautiful late-�summer day. She had a free hour before her lesson with the chaplain, and was determined to waste not a minute of it. In a trice she had summoned her maid, changed into her everyday worsted, descended the stairs and crossed the stone drawbridge across the castle moat; then she picked up her skirts and ran through the gardens into the meadows by the River Eden, where she loved to wander.<br><br>From here she had a grand view of moated Hever Castle, her family&#x2019;s seat, and the lush wooded Kentish countryside that cradled it. But of greater interest was the sight of her beloved brother George lying sprawled in the grass, twanging his lute, his dark brown hair tousled, his clothes crumpled.<br><br>&#x201c;They are looking for you indoors,&#x201d; she told him, kneeling down. &#x201c;You should be at your books. You&#x2019;ll be beaten if you don&#x2019;t go back.&#x201d;<br><br>George grinned up at her. &#x201c;I had an idea for a song. Listen!&#x201d;<br><br>He played well for a boy of nine, and his composition had the sophistication one would have expected from someone far older. He was gifted, this brother of hers. He could make his mark as a musician if he did not carve out a career at court, as their father expected.<br><br>They had always been close, Anne and George. They looked alike and thought alike.<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know&#x2014;�I can&#x2019;t spend my days making music and writing poetry,&#x201d; he sighed, mimicking Father&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;Much good it would do you! And in the end you would not be satisfied. It would never be enough for you. So stop playing truant. Father Davy is livid.&#x201d;<br><br>For all her mock reproof, she felt sorry for George. She knew how deeply it gnawed at him, being the youngest of three sons. It was sixteen-�year-�old Thomas who would inherit Hever and all their father&#x2019;s lands and wealth&#x2014;�and it was Thomas who, to George&#x2019;s envy, had been sent to the household of the mighty Duke of Buckingham at nearby Penshurst to learn courtly manners and the martial arts, which would befit him for the glorious future that awaited him. And then there was clever Henry, twelve years old and destined for the university at Oxford, since Father had decided to dedicate him to the Church&#x2014;�and save himself the burden of having to provide for him. There had been other sons too, but they slept in St. Peter&#x2019;s Church, to their mother&#x2019;s great grief. Anne had never gotten used to the appalling sight of her tiny dead siblings lying in their cradles, all decked out in macabre finery, to receive the final prayers and farewells of their family.<br><br>Lady Boleyn doted on George, her youngest, more than she did on Thomas and Henry. But in George&#x2019;s breast there burned a fierce resentment against his older brothers. Unlike them, he must make his own way in the world. Father reminded him of it often.<br><br>Given her rivalry with Mary, and George&#x2019;s envy of their older brothers, Anne often felt that it was a case of her and George, the two youngest Boleyns, against the world. Because she did not have looks and he was not the heir, they had pulled together since they were very little. Some took them for twins.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; she commanded, pulling him up, and together they raced back to the castle.<br><br>Father Davy was waiting for them as they sped across the courtyard and tumbled into Father&#x2019;s new entrance hall. Their tutor was a rotund little man with a merry face and cheeks rosy as apples.<br><br>&#x201c;Ah, you&#x2019;ve deigned to grace us with your presence,&#x201d; he said to George. &#x201c;And mightily timely too, for we&#x2019;ve just had word that your father is expected home this evening, and we wouldn&#x2019;t want to greet him with the news that you&#x2019;re in disgrace, would we?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, Father Davy.&#x201d; George was trying to look contrite.<br><br>&#x201c;Mistress Anne, you may join us,&#x201d; Father Davy said. &#x201c;You can set an example to this young knave.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mary?&#x201d; George asked, rolling his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;Reading,&#x201d; said Father Davy. &#x201c;I have given her a book on kings and queens. It will improve her mind.&#x201d; It was no secret that he had almost given up on Mary.<br><br>Anne followed them into the private parlor used by the family in the evenings, and sat down at the oak table. She knew she was fortunate, being a girl, to receive a good education. Father had very advanced ideas, but then he was always concerned that his children should do well in life&#x2014;�which, of course, would reflect favorably on him. Accomplished in foreign tongues himself&#x2014;�which was why he had been away these last weeks at the court of the Regent of the Netherlands at Mechlin in the Duchy of Burgundy&#x2014;�he was particularly anxious that his sons and daughters become proficient too.<br><br>Anne struggled with French, despite excelling at everything else. Mary was good at French, but dismal in all other respects. Anne could compose passable poetry and songs, thanks to Father Davy being a famous composer of church music and a gifted teacher. Mary battled, murdering her lute; it did not help that she was tone deaf. Anne danced gracefully; Mary galumphed about the floor. Anne sang like a lark; Mary&#x2019;s voice was flat. But Mary had the looks, everyone said, so it didn&#x2019;t matter that she was an idiot. Most men would not see beyond her beauty and the dowry Father could give her. Thus it did not matter that, when the time for lessons arrived, she was rarely to be found.<br><br>Most of the daughters of the local gentry in the Boleyns&#x2019; circle could barely wield a pen, Anne reflected, as her quill traced her graceful Italianate hand across the paper. Today&#x2019;s exercise was composing a letter in French, which was a challenge, but she was determined to persevere. She enjoyed learning for its own sake, and reveled in the praise Father Davy lavished on her.<br><br>From the kitchens nearby they could hear a great clatter and commotion. The household was preparing for the return of its master, and Mother would be giving orders and inspecting the cooking pots, much to the cook&#x2019;s ill-�concealed annoyance. There would be a feast tonight, Anne thought happily.<br><br>Dressed in the new green gown, Anne stole a peep at the great hall, where the tables had been beautifully laid with snowy-�white linen. The best silver was set out on the high table above the great gilt salt, with polished pewter on the lower trestles set at right angles to it. Banks of greenery trailed along the center of the boards, interspersed with candles and ewers of wine. Hever was a small castle, and the hall not large compared to some she had seen, but it was sufficiently grand for an up-�and-�coming diplomat and favorite of the King, with its great stone fireplace and imposing carved screen. The early evening sunshine cast a golden glow through the tall windows set high in the thick walls, reflecting its jewel-�like glints on the impressive display of family plate on the buffet and the expensive wall hangings. Father liked to impress his neighbors with his wealth. They were all coming tonight: the Wyatts from Allington, the Sackvilles from Buckhurst Park, and the Hautes from Ightham Mote.<br><br>Normally the family dined in the parlor, seated at the long polished table. It was a cozy room, its walls adorned with wainscot of oak and painted friezes, and hung with another of the costly tapestries of which Father was inordinately proud. But that was all familiar and commonplace; feasting in the great hall was an occasion, and Anne was impatient for it to begin.<br><br>Father was home, and she had been summoned to see him in his study before dinner. There he sat, in his high carved chair, nodding as she made her curtsey: the man who had dominated her life for as long as she could remember, whose lightest word was law to his family and servants, and to whom Anne and her brothers and sister had been brought up to render unconditional obedience. When she and Mary married, their husbands would take over his role. It had been drummed into them both that women were weak creatures and should always be subject to the wise dominion of men.<br><br>When Sir Thomas Boleyn was at home, the household revolved around him, but that was a rare occurrence. When he was not abroad using the diplomatic skills that had so endeared him to King Henry, he was usually at court, building on his reputation as a jouster and courtier and all-�round good fellow. At thirty-�four, he was still a handsome and agile man, and sat a horse superbly. He was outstandingly learned&#x2014;�it seemed to his children that he knew everything&#x2014;�and even the great Dutch scholar Erasmus had dedicated two books to him. Thanks to these virtues he had risen high and fast in royal service, becoming one of King Henry&#x2019;s best friends and jousting partners, and never tired of reminding everyone of it. He had been knighted at the King&#x2019;s coronation, three years earlier, and then appointed Esquire of the Body to the monarch.<br><br>&#x201c;It is a most sought-�after post,&#x201d; he was prone to boasting, &#x201c;for it brings me into daily contact with the King. I enjoy great influence. I have His Grace&#x2019;s ear.&#x201d; He would gleefully expand on the patronage he was in a position to exercise. Anne understood that there were many people who wanted Sir Thomas Boleyn to ask the King for favors, and that they were ready to pay him a lot of money to do that.<br><br>She was pleased to see Father&#x2019;s pugnacious face broaden into a wolfish smile as she rose from her curtsey. &#x201c;I have some good news,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The Regent Margaret was most interested to hear of your accomplishments and has offered to take you into her household as one of her eighteen maids of honor. It is a signal favor, much sought after.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Me, sir?&#x201d; Anne echoed. &#x201c;Surely Mary . . . ?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, it is highly unusual for the younger sister to be advanced before the elder, and Mary speaks good French. But,&#x201d; and he gave Anne a calculating look, &#x201c;I believe that you have what it takes to succeed at court and be a credit to me. Besides, I have other plans for Mary. And the Regent specially asked for you.&#x201d;<br><br>Anne felt excitement bubbling up.<br><br>&#x201c;When am I to go, sir?&#x201d; she breathed, envisaging the glorious palaces, the fine gowns, the glittering lords and ladies, the Regent smiling as she made her obeisance with everyone looking on.<br><br>&#x201c;Next spring,&#x201d; her father said, and the bubble burst. That was months away. &#x201c;There will be many preparations to make. Your mother will know what is required. I&#x2019;d rather it be you than the Devil who makes work for idle hands.&#x201d; He and Mother barely spoke to each other unless they had to.<br><br>&#x201c;You must work hard at your French,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;You will complete your education at the court of Burgundy. There is no finer place, for it offers many opportunities for a young girl of good birth, and is universally well regarded. You will be well placed to attract a marriage that will advance the interests of our family. I hope you appreciate your good fortune.&#x201d;</p><h2>Owls Aren't Wise &amp; Bats Aren't Blind: A Naturalist Debunks Our Favorite Fallacies About Wildlife</h2><p><b>In this fascinating book, wildlife expert and enthusiast Warner Shedd refutes popular animal myths like squirrels remembering where they bury nuts, wolves howling at the moon, and oppossums "playing dead."</b><br><br>Have you ever seen a flying squirrel flapping through the air, watched a beaver carrying a load of mud on its tail, or ducked when a porcupine started throwing its quills? Probably not, says Shedd,&nbsp;former regional executive for the National Wildlife Federation.&nbsp;Offering&nbsp;scientific evidence that refutes many of the most tenacious and persevering folklore about wild animals,&nbsp;<i>Owls Aren't Wise &amp; Bats Aren't Blind&nbsp;</i>will captivate you with fascinating facts and humorous anecdotes about more than thirty&nbsp;North American species-- some as familiar as the common toad, and others as elusive as the lynx.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Owls Aren't Wise &amp; Bats Aren't Blind&nbsp;</i>is an entertaining dose of scientific reality for any nature enthusiast or armchair adventurer.</p><p>Ever pick up a toad only to have it soak your hand? Don't worry, it was the animal's emergency water storage (not urine!), dumped in a fight-or-flight panic. Think that new beaver clan will dent the trout population in your favorite fishing hole? They don't touch the stuff: beavers are strictly vegan. And go ahead, get close to that porcupine, because they can't fire quills like an AK-47. Want more? Warner Shedd, a native Vermonter, lifelong naturalist, former Forest Service honcho, and a retired executive for the National Wildlife Federation, dispels wildlife fallacies that have passed through generations of well-intended grandfathers and poorly informed folk tales. Shedd covers everything about most backyard critters--from gray squirrels to newts--and expands on some wilder species that we only think we understand. <p> But Shedd's refreshing anecdotes aren't entirely naysaying. In fact, he confirms many myths with a bit of explanatory elaboration. Take the raven's knack for mimicry, for example; it's entirely capable of uttering "nevermore" if it desires. And while bats aren't entirely blind, Shedd writes, they rely largely on echolocation to navigate, bouncing high-frequency shrieks off nearby objects, sometimes in the range of 115 kilohertz (a human's range goes to a mere 20 kHz). </p><p> While these details gives us some solid facts to gnash on, it's Shedd's personal anecdotes (much to the dismay of his resilient Labrador Heidi, who, while accompanying Shedd, has been jumped by muskrats and porcupines, among other things) that elevate his information to entertainment. Retelling stories from his boyhood in Vermont and from his professional work, he takes the reader on a ride through familiar territory: describing roadside carcasses, trash-ravaging raccoons, and clumsy coyotes, among other encounters. To keep us current, however, Shedd updates ongoing conservation efforts and opens an occasional window into his own personal opinions on wildlife management. We're left with a satisfying, inspiring handbook to some of North America's most familiar and erroneously understood creatures. <i>--Lolly Merrell</i></p>that "flying" squirrels are incapable of true flight? Were you aware that opossums don't "play dead," as in the common folk saying "playing possum"? In this fascinating and gorgeously illustrated new book, wildlife expert and enthusiast Warner Shedd, former executive for the National Wildlife Federation, uncovers the scientific realities obscured by our numerous long-held misconceptions of wild animals. Setting the most tenacious of these age-old superstitions against evidence that he and other biologists and naturalists have gleaned from careful observation and investigation, Shedd refutes such popular myths as beavers can fell trees in a desired direction, gray squirrels remember where they bury nuts, wolves howl at the moon, and cougars are an endangered species. <br><br>In addition to dispelling misinformation, <b>Owls Aren't Wise &amp; Bats Aren't Blind</b> presents some fascinating facts about the animals that many of us encounter in our own backyards o</p><h2>Yosemite Meditations</h2><p>This delightful little book provides the ideal pause for contemplating the special qualities and values of Yosemite National Park, as well as other parks and wilderness.

This book tells the story of Judaism's encounter with Buddhism in the United States, showing how it has given rise to new contemplative forms within American Judaism&#x2015;and shaped the way Americans understand and practice Buddhism.</p><p>Taking readers from the nineteenth century to today, Emily Sigalow traces the history of these two traditions in America and explains how they came together. She argues that the distinctive social position of American Jews led them to their unique engagement with Buddhism, and describes how people incorporate aspects of both into their everyday lives. Drawing on a wealth of original in-depth interviews conducted across the nation, Sigalow explores how Jewish American Buddhists experience their dual religious identities. She reveals how Jewish Buddhists confound prevailing expectations of minority religions in America. Rather than simply adapting to the majority religion, Jews and Buddhists have borrowed and integrated elements from each other, and in doing so they have left an enduring mark on the American consciousness.</p><p><i>American JewBu</i> highlights the leading role that American Jews have played in the popularization of meditation and mindfulness in the United States, and the profound impact that these two venerable traditions have had on one another.</p></p><p><b>Emily Sigalow </b>is a sociologist of contemporary Jewish life and Executive Director of the Impact and Performance Assessment Department at the UJA-Federation of New York, a leading Jewish philanthropic organization. emilysigalow.com"In this compelling and insightful book, Sigalow offers a window into the varied ways that Jews in the United States have been engaged in religious, spiritual, and secularized paths toward creating a Jewish Buddhist sense of self."<b>--Janet Jacobs, author of <i>The Holocaust across Generations: Trauma and Its Inheritance among Descendants of Survivors</i></b><br><br>"This excellent book is essential reading on the development of American Buddhism and a fascinating exploration of why Buddhism is so popular among American Jews."<b>--Erik Braun, author of <i>The Birth of Insight: Meditation, Modern Buddhism, and the Burmese Monk Ledi Sayadaw </i></b><br><br>"<i>American JewBu</i> deals with a phenomenon widely known but never before systematically studied. Drawing on history and sociology, it traces the Jewish-Buddhist encounter from its nineteenth-century origins to the present, shedding immense new light on why Jews turned to Buddhism, how the encounter reconfigured both faiths, and what JewBu syncretism teaches us about American religion as a whole. A model study by a scholar of immense promise."<b>--Jonathan D. Sarna, author of <i>American Judaism: A History</i></b><br><br>"Emily Sigalow offers a detailed historical and contemporary account of JewBus, often commented on but rarely studied.

I strongly recommend it."<b>--Wendy Cadge, Brandeis University</b><br><br>"Sigalow combines ethnographic research with thoughtful historical and cultural analysis to produce a convincing portrait of Jewish Buddhists in America. She skillfully surpasses simplistic explanations of the JewBu phenomenon to provide the richest historical and social account to date. <i>American JewBu</i> not only convincingly explores how and why so many Jews have taken up Buddhism, it demonstrates the crucial role Jews have played in shaping what Buddhism has become in the West."<b>--David L.

But it wasn&#x2019;t always like that. The development of the Near West Side began a long time ago, when, in 1807, pioneer families the Lords and the Barbers came from the East Coast to the area as investors in what some say was one of the biggest real estate deals ever.</p> <p>The Lords and Barbers were part of a group of early settlers who bought the right to own land in the Western Reserve, which was then owned by the state of Connecticut. The Western Reserve stretched from the Pennsylvania border 120 miles west to the area near Sandusky between Lake Erie on the north and the area just south of Akron and Youngstown.</p> <p>Together, this group of investors put up over one million dollars&#x2015;a huge amount of money back then. Each investor was given the chance to obtain plots of the land through a drawing in April, 1807. The Lords and Barbers pulled the largest parcel, which stretched from the Cuyahoga River to W. 117th and from Lake Erie to Brookpark Road, naming it Brooklyn Township.</p> <p>These pioneers had the land surveyed, and in 1836 further incorporated an area from the Cuyahoga River to W. 58th Street, from Lake Erie to Walworth Run, near the present day Rapid tracks. They called this area the City of Ohio. The center of the City of Ohio was called Market Square, and it extended from W. 25th to W. 38th Street. The turnpike (what we now refer to as Pearl Road or W. 25th Street) was the main road in the area.</p> <p>Until 1854, the City of Cleveland and the City of Ohio were totally separate. In June of 1854, the City of Ohio and some of the area surrounding it was annexed to Cleveland. It then grew to become known as the Near West Side of Cleveland.</p> <p>More recently, other kinds of &#x201c;labels&#x201d; have been given to divisions of Cleveland&#x2019;s lands. The Strategic Planning Areas (SPAs) define areas one way; the police districts another; and the City Council yet another.</p> <p>Many &#x201c;regular&#x201d; people don&#x2019;t use any of these categories when they say where they live or work &#x2015;they just say &#x201c;around such and such street&#x201d; or the Near West End.</p> <p>Overall, we consider the Near West Side as the part nearest the Cuyahoga River, out west to about the Boulevard, and from the Lake south to Denison.</p> <p>&#x2013; Patricia Ehlen Milenius</p> <p></p> <p>[Excerpted from <em>Whatever Happened to the "Paper Rex" Man?</em>, � The May Dugan Center.

But in <i>Game Over</i>, celebrated alt-sportswriter Dave Zirin proves once and for all that politics has breached the modern sports arena with a vengeance. From the NFL lockout and the role of soccer in the Arab Spring to the Penn State sexual abuse scandals and Tim Tebow&#x2019;s on-field genuflections, this timely and hard-hitting new book from the conscience of American sportswriting&#x201d; (<i>The Washington Post</i>) reveals how our most important debates about class, race, religion, sex, and the raw quest for political power are played out both on and off the field.<br> <br> <i>Game Over</i> offers new insights and analysis of headline-grabbing sports controversies, exploring the shady side of the NCAA, the explosive 2011 MLB All-Star Game, and why the Dodgers crashed and burned. It covers the fascinating struggles of gay and lesbian athletes to gain acceptance, female athletes to be more than sex symbols, and athletes everywhere to assert their collective bargaining rights as union members. Zirin also illustrates the ways in which athletes are once again using their exalted platforms to speak out and reclaim sports from the corporate interests that have taken it hostage. In <i>Game Over</i>, he cheers the victories but also reflects on how far we have yet to go. Combining brilliant set pieces with a sobering overview of today&#x2019;s sports scene in Zirin&#x2019;s take-no-prisoners style, <i>Game Over</i> is a must read for anyone, sports fan or not, interested in understanding how sports reflect and shape society&#x2014;and why the stakes have never been higher.</p><p>One of the <i>UTNE Reader</i>&#x2019;s 50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Our World,&#x201d; <b>Dave Zirin</b> is a columnist for <i>The Nation</i>, <i>SLAM</i> magazine, and SI.com.

His previous books include <i>A People&#x2019;s History of Sports in the United States</i> and <i>Bad Sports: How Owners Are Ruining the Games We Love</i> (both available from The New Press). He lives near Washington, D.C.<br>Short of wearing out the subject of politics in sports (Bad Sports, 2010, and A People&#x2019;s History of Sports in the United States, 2008), sports analyst Zirin focuses here on the pushback by athletes and fans around the globe against injustices they see, whether in sports alone or on the larger political stage. For example, the NBA&#x2019;s Phoenix Suns changed their name to Los Suns for their 2010 Cinco de Mayo game versus the San Antonio Spurs to express their solidarity with Arizona&#x2019;s Hispanics over the state&#x2019;s tough anti-immigration laws. The NFL Players Association stood against Wisconsin governor Scott Walker&#x2019;s efforts to strip collective bargaining rights from public workers there. And there was worldwide support of South African runner Caster Semenya, who won silver in the women&#x2019;s 800-meter event at the 2012 London Games, over questions regarding the legitimacy of her stated gender. Other subjects include the Penn State scandal, the public reaction to Linsanity, and the continued objectification of women in sports.

Yet she refuses to forget her best friend Elizabeth, whom she is convinced is missing and in terrible danger.</p><p>But no one will listen to Maud&#x2014;not her frustrated daughter, Helen, not her caretakers, not the police, and especially not Elizabeth&#x2019;s mercurial son, Peter. Armed with handwritten notes she leaves for herself and an overwhelming feeling that Elizabeth needs her help, Maud resolves to discover the truth and save her beloved friend.</p><p>This singular obsession forms a cornerstone of Maud&#x2019;s rapidly dissolving present. But the clues she discovers seem only to lead her deeper into her past, to another unsolved disappearance: her sister, Sukey, who vanished shortly after World War II.</p><p>As vivid memories of a tragedy that occurred more fifty years ago come flooding back, Maud discovers new momentum in her search for her friend. Could the mystery of Sukey&#x2019;s disappearance hold the key to finding Elizabeth?</p></p><p>Kimberly McCreight Emma Healey <p><b></b></p> <b>Kimberly McCreight, author of the New York Times bestselling Reconstructing Amelia, interviews Emma Healey</b> <p></p> <p>Kimberly McCreight (KM): One of the things I most admire about Elizabeth is Missing&#x2014;and there is so much to admire&#x2014;is the utterly convincing voice of Maud, both in her advanced years and when she is much younger. How did you tackle the challenge of presenting a single character at such disparate times within a single narrative? </p> <p>Emma Healey (EH): I&#x2019;m so glad it&#x2019;s convincing, thank you. I started with Maud&#x2019;s voice as an eighty-year-old and found that only needed a little adjusting to take her back into childhood. The voice overall is very much based on my mother&#x2019;s mother, Vera. I was very close to her and she had (ironically) a brilliant memory and had lots of stories to tell about her early life. I spent most of my school holidays with her, so remembering and sticking to the kind of words she would have used gave me a guide for Maud&#x2019;s lexicon. Voice is so much about vocabulary. I do have to say though, I think writing from the point-of-view of a single character, even in two time frames, is much easier than swapping between characters. Reading Reconstructing Amelia, I am amazed at how well you alternate a first-person and third-person narrative, from the point-of-view of a teenager and a mother, as well as using Facebook statuses and text messages, all in one novel. I should be asking you how you made that work so well!</p> <p> KM: Was there something that drew you to writing about a character losing her grip on reality, particularly one struggling with dementia?</p> <p>EH: The initial inspiration for the book came from my father's mother, Nancy, who has multi-infarct dementia, but my aunt&#x2019;s mother-in-law had suffered from Alzheimer&#x2019;s for several years before that and other members of my family had had various forms of dementia. At the time, dementia wasn&#x2019;t something that was being talked about so much and I was fascinated (as well as terrified and upset) by the way a person could come and go&#x2014;one minute their old selves, the next in a world of their own. Their patterns of behavior could be anything from perfectly reasonable to completely bizarre and it seemed like there was a lot more going on under the surface, which was difficult to discover or explain, and this seemed ripe for fictional exploration.</p> <p> KM: Elizabeth is Missing has such a smooth, flawless structure. You move so nimbly through time, without relying on chapter breaks or some such device to delineate different sections. It works so well that I think any demarcations would have interfered with the story. Can you talk a bit about the decision to include chapters that switch back and forth through time? </p> <p>EH: Thank you. Again, I&#x2019;m really glad you think so. The structure happened fairly organically. I felt that a dialogue between current and past events was truer to the way memories work &#x2013; they break into your immediate thoughts, rather than wait for you to decide to have them &#x2013; and I wanted the sections to be relatively short in order to mirror the fragmentary experience of dementia. Not dividing the past and present into separate chapters made it easier too to increase the length of the past story as Maud&#x2019;s preoccupation with it intensified (and as her awareness of the world around her faded), without signaling too heavily to the reader and without losing the thread or balance of either narrative.</p> <p>KM: Your book is both a compelling emotional story as well as a mystery. Which comes first for you?</p> <p>EH: I find plotting a book very exciting, and really enjoy trying to weave in narrative strands and tie up all the ends, but I have to feel there is some real experience behind the story, some &#x201c;truth&#x201d; that I&#x2019;m attempting to represent, too. And these two things seem to me to be inextricably linked. It&#x2019;s much easier to engage emotionally when there is an intriguing story unfolding &#x2013; a dull character or a character in a dull situation is difficult to take an interest in, even if they are sympathetic. Similarly, for a mystery to work and for the reader to care whether, and how, it is solved, there needs to be a certain amount of emotional investment in the characters and themes.</p> <p>KM: I couldn&#x2019;t agree more. There needs to be a constant dialogue between character and story. Trying to achieve that balance is, for me, one of the greatest joys and the greatest challenges of being a novelist. What's your biggest challenge as a writer?</p> <p>EH: Being a writer means being constantly mentally engaged. This is great in some ways as it&#x2019;s exciting and gives a context and significance to every aspect of life, but it also means there are no off-duty hours. So anytime I&#x2019;m not writing (or not observing, listening, note-taking), I&#x2019;m feeling guilty about it. Justifying writing is sometimes difficult, too: Why this subject? Why this character? But most of all, why me? What can I offer that another writer couldn&#x2019;t? A terrible question because the answer is invariably nothing.</p> <p>KM: You&#x2019;re right, that &#x201c;why&#x201d; is very important. It inevitably pushes your story to a much stronger place. What's your background? Elizabeth is Missing is such an accomplished debut, I'm assuming&#x2014;okay, maybe hoping&#x2014;there was some writing that came before it. Otherwise, I might be far too jealous.</p> <p>EH: Ha ha! Well, I wrote lots of bits of things, of course, but I hadn&#x2019;t really finished anything before Elizabeth is Missing. My first degree was in Book Arts, and the course did offer a Creative Writing module, but I was too shy to take it. Instead, I learned how to sew pages together and foil block and print. I was always an avid reader though, and I began to take short courses in writing and editing after I graduated and started the novel while I was working in an art gallery in London.

But even as her memory disintegrates and she becomes increasingly dependent on the trail of handwritten notes she leaves for herself in her pockets and around her house, Maud cannot forget her best friend.

When a man slaps another couple&#x2019;s child at a neighborhood barbecue, the event send unforeseeable shock waves through the lives of all who are witness to it. Told from the points of view of eight people who were present,&nbsp;<i>The Slap</i>&nbsp;shows how a single action can change the way people think about how they live, what they want, and what they believe forever.</p><p><b>Christos Tsiolkas</b> is an award-winning novelist, playwright, essayist, and screenwriter. His fiction has won numerous prizes, including the Commonwealth Writers Award, the Age Fiction Prize, and the Melbourne Best Writing Award. <i>The Slap</i> is his first book published in the US.<b>HECTOR</b><p>His eyes still shut, a dream dissolving and already impossible to recall, Hector&#x2019;s hand sluggishly reached across the bed. Good. Aish was up. He let out a victorious fart, burying his face deep into the pillow to escape the clammy methane stink. I don&#x2019;t want to sleep in a boy&#x2019;s locker room, Aisha would always complain on the rare, inadvertent moments when he forgot himself in front of her. Through the years he had learned to rein his body in, to allow himself to only let go in solitude; farting and pissing in the shower, burping alone in the car, not washing or brushing his teeth all weekend when she was away at conferences. It was not that his wife was a prude, she just seemed to barely tolerate the smells and expressions of the male body. He himself would have no problem falling asleep in a girl&#x2019;s locker room, surround by the moist, heady fragrance of sweet young cunt. Afloat, still half-entrapped in sleep&#x2019;s tender clutch, he twisted onto his back and shifted the sheet off his body. Sweet young cunt. He&#x2019;d spoken out loud.</p><p>Connie.</p><p>At the thought of her, sleep surrendered its grip on him. Aish would think him a pervert if she had overheard him. But he was definitely not that. He simply loved women. Young, old, those just starting to blossom and those beginning to fade. And sheepishly, almost embarrassed at his own vanity, he knew that women loved him. Women <i>loved</i> him.</p><p>Get up, Hector, he said to himself. Time for the routine.</p><p>The routine was a series of exercise that he executed without fail every morning. At most, it never lasted more than twenty minutes. Occasionally, if he woke with a headache or hangover, or with a combination of both, or simply with an ennui that seemed to issue from deep within what he could only assume to be his soul, he managed to complete it all in under ten minutes. It was not strict adherence to the routine that mattered but simply ensuring its completion&#x2014;even when he was sick, he would force himself to do it. He would rise,&nbsp; grab a pair of track-pants, throw on the T-shirt he&#x2019;d worn the previous day and then perform a series of nine stretches, each of which he would hold to a count of thirty. Then he would lie on the rug in the bedroom and perform one hundred and fifty sit-ups, and fifty push-ups. He&#x2019;d finish with a final set of three stretches. Then he&#x2019;d go to the kitchen and switch on the coffee percolator before walking to the milk bar at the end of the street to buy the newspaper and a packet of cigarettes. Back home, he would pour himself a coffee, walk out on the back verandah, light a smoke, turn to the sports pages, and begin to read. In that moment, with the newspaper spread before him, the whiff of bitter coffee in his nostrils, the first hit of sharp tobacco smoke, whatever the miseries, petty bullshits, stresses and anxieties of the day before or the day ahead, none of it mattered. In that moment, if only in that moment, he was happy.</p><p>Hector had discovered from childhood that the only way to challenge the inert, suffocating joy of sleep was to barrel right through it, to force open his eyes and jump straight out of the bed. But for once, he lay back on his pillow and allowed the sounds of his family to gently bring him to complete wakefulness. Aisha had the kitchen stereo turned to an FM classical music station, and Beethoven&#x2019;s Ninth Symphony was flooding the house. From the lounge room, he could hear the electronic squeaks and tinny reverb of a computer game. He lay still for a moment, then threw back the sheet and looked down at his naked body. He raised his right foot and watched it crash back on the bed. Today&#x2019;s the day, Hector, he told himself, today&#x2019;s the day. He leapt out of bed and put on a pair of red Y-fronts, pulled a singlet over his head, took a long, loud piss in the ensuite, and stormed into the kitchen. Aisha was breaking eggs over a frying pan and he kissed her neck. The kitchen smelt of coffee. He switched off the radio in mid-crescendo.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, I was listening to that.&#x201d;</p><p>Hector flicked through the nest of CDs stacked clumsily next to the CD player. He pulled a disc out of its case and put it into the machine. He pushed through the numbers till he found the track he wanted, then smiled as the first confident notes of Louis Armstrong&#x2019;s trumpet began to sound. He kissed his wife&#x2019;s neck again.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be Satchmo today,&#x201d; he whispered to her. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s got to be &#x2018;West End Blues.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>He performed his exercises slowly, counting up to thirty in slow, measured breaths. Between each set he swayed to the slow-building sensual progression of jazz music. He made sure that with every sit-up he felt the tightening of the muscles in his belly, and with every push-up, he was conscious of the pull of the muscles on his triceps and pecs. He wanted to be alert to his body today. He wanted to know that it was alive, strong and prepared.</p><p>On finishing, he wiped the sweat from his brow, picked his shirt off the floor where he had flung it the night before, and slipped his feet into his sandals.</p><p>&#x201c;Want anything from the shop?&#x201d;</p><p>Aisha laughed at him. &#x201c;You look like a bum.&#x201d;</p><p>She would never leave the house without make-up or proper clothes on. Not that she used much make-up; she had no need to&#x2014;it was one of the things that very early on attracted him to her. He had never been fond of girls who wore thickly applied foundation, powder and lipstick. He thought it was sluttish, and even though he was aware of the ridiculous conservatism of his response, he could not bring himself to admire a heavily painted woman, no matter how objectively beautiful she might be. Aisha didn&#x2019;t need the assistance of make-up. Her dark skin was supple, unblemished, and her large, deep-set, obliquely sloping eyes shone in her long, lean, sculptured face.</p><p>Hector looked down at his slippers, and smile. &#x201c;So can this bum get you anything from the shop?&#x201d;</p><p>She shook her head. &#x201c;Nah. But you&#x2019;re going to the markets this morning, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I said I would, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;</p><p>She glanced up at the kitchen clock. &#x201c;You better hurry.&#x201d;</p><p>He said nothing to her, irritated by her comment. He didn&#x2019;t want to hurry this morning. He wanted to take it slow and easy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Reprinted by arrangement with&nbsp;Penguin, a member of Penguin Group (USA) Inc., from<i>&nbsp;The Slap</i> by Christos Tsiolkas.</p><p>Copyright �&nbsp;2008 by&nbsp;Christos Tsiolkas</p></p><h2>Meeting of Minds : The Complete Scripts, With Illustrations, of the Amazingly Successful PBS-TV Series - Series I</h2><p>The man who invented the television talk show surpassed even himself when he created Meeting of Minds, the award-winning series that captured America&#39;s imagination. These four volumes offer the original scripts from the series, including material edited from the broadcast versions that ran from 1977 to 1981 on PBS stations nationwide.Many believe that Meeting of Minds is the most brilliant series ever to be written for television. The show provides a groundbreaking opportunity to be exposed to ideas by way of a medium not normally known for its intellectual vigor.Indeed, Meeting of Minds grew out of Allen&#39;s frustration with the mediocrity of the average network program. He envisioned the show as a stimulating round-table discussion conducted like any other talk show - except that the participants would be actors portraying some of the greatest minds and most prominent figures of history. Accordingly, such characters as Aristotle, Catherine the Great, Oliver Cromwell, Emily Dickinson, Margaret Sanger, Gandhi, Thomas Paine, Cleopatra, Theodore Roosevelt, and St. Thomas Aquinas appear in startlingly effective juxtaposition, their characters revealed through brilliantly conceived dialogue.This first volume features appearances by President Theodore Roosevelt, Queen Cleopatra, Thomas Aquinas, Thomas Paine, President Ulysses S. Grant, Queen Marie Antoinette, Sir Thomas More, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Emily Dickinson, Galileo Galilei, and Attila the Hun.The scripts for Meeting of Minds make for excellent reading, distilling an enormous amount of research into a lively format that has the undeniable veracity of historical fact. The result is unfailingly witty, thought-provoking, and geniunely entertaining.Steve Allen&#39;s lucidity and fertile intelligence are evident on every page. Meeting of Minds remains one of the freshest, most delightful ways of gaining historical perspective ever devised, an incomparable tour de force with the power to make history come alive.</p><p><b>Steve Allen </b>(1921-2000) was known as television's renaissance man.

This is the often-overlooked story of how alcohol has shaped American events and the American character from the seventeenth to the twentieth century.<br></strong><br>Seen through the lens of alcoholism, American history takes on a vibrancy and a tragedy missing from many earlier accounts. From the drunkenness of the Pilgrims to Prohibition hijinks, drinking has always been a cherished American custom: a way to celebrate and a way to grieve and a way to take the edge off. At many pivotal points in our history-the illegal <i>Mayflower</i> landing at Cape Cod, the enslavement of African Americans, the McCarthy witch hunts, and the Kennedy assassination, to name only a few-alcohol has acted as a catalyst.<br><br>Some nations drink more than we do, some drink less, but no other nation has been the drunkest in the world as America was in the 1830s only to outlaw drinking entirely a hundred years later.

Though nothing is as simple as it might appear to be, we could describe this as a story about Allen, who is married to Maud but having an affair with Elizabeth, who lives with Maud. Or say it is a story about fraud in the art world, horse racing, and sexual intrigues. Or, as one critic did, compare it to a Jane Austen creation, or to an Aldous Huxley novel - and be right and wrong on both counts.</p><p>Born in New York in 1930, Harry Mathews settled in Europe in 1952 and has since then lived in Spain, Germany, Italy, and (chiefly) France. When Mathews published his first poems in 1956, he was associated with the so-called New York School of poets, with three of whom (John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and James Schuyler) he founded the review Locus Solus in 1961. Through his friendship with Georges Perec, he became a member of the Oulipo in 1972. The author of six novels and several collections of poetry, recent publications are THE NEW TOURISM (Sand Paper Press, 2010), Sainte Catherine, a novella written in French (Editions P.O.L, 2000), The Human Country: the Collected Short Stories (Dalkey Archive Press, 2002), The Case of the Persevering Maltese: Collected Essays (Dalkey Archive Press, 2003), OULIPO COMPENDIUM (co-edited with Alastair Brotchie; Atlas Press and Make Now Press, 2005), and My Life in CIA: A Chronicle of 1973 (Dalkey Archive Press, 2005).From Allan and Elizabeth: "What's he mean, 'I suppose you want an explanation'? He doesn't explain anything." <p>The gabled house loomed over us like a buzzard stuffed in mid flight. People were still arriving. Through the lilac hedge came the rustle of gravel smoothly compressed, and swinging streaks of light that flashed beyond us along a pale bank of Japanese dogwood, where a man in a white dinner jacket stood inspecting Allan's letter with a penlight. </p><p>He passed the letter around. When it was my turn I read, in another revolution of headlights, ". . . the state I was in--barely seeing you when they were taking me away . . . Darkness, blinding light . . . I couldn't manage a squeak." I too was confused. Even dazzled by Elizabeth, could this be Allan? </p><p>I wanted to understand. I planned someday to write a book about these people. I wanted the whole story. </p><p>After an absence of many years Elizabeth that day had come back to town. A little after midnight she went to the "casino," as the last private gambling club was called. Allan was leaving. Having drunk too much and started a noisy argument, he was being politely bounced. He passed Elizabeth in the glare of the lobby. At the door he was told, "Next time, Mr. Ludlam, please keep it down. And watch yourself on the road." </p><p>"Thank you. Who is she?" </p><p>"Beats me." </p><p>Outside, the night was hot and starry. Allan started driving home, stopping on the way at the Spa City Diner. Maud would have long been asleep. </p><p>He had two cups of coffee, chatting with late-night customers. He wished he could visualize Elizabeth exactly. (He remembered the sparse whiteness of her clothes, the flurry of her red-gold hair.) He knew she had seen him; her ready acceptance of him in those circumstances made him wince. </p><p>Allan had cleverness, if not wisdom, and he prized it. He held the world and himself in contempt. Recently he had shown kindness to me when few others had. My best friend had died, and gossips had cruelly blamed me for it. "You're lucky," Allan told me, "learning young what bastards people are. 'People,'" he added, "includes me." He meant that befriending me made him no better than the others, only smarter. He mistrusted his own decency. </p><p>On his way home, passing the Adelphi, he saw a red-haired figure in white crossing the faintly lighted porch. He braked. Perhaps a minute passed while he recollected that he was a local worthy, that he had already demeaned himself, that he was still drunk. He parked his car and went into the hotel. On night duty he found Wally, who had know him for thirty years. Allan asked if it was too late for a nightcap. Wally said, hold the fort, he wouldn't be a minute. </p><p>The lobby looked empty. Allan stepped behind the front desk to examine in the open register the arrivals on this first day of July. He stopped at a familiar name: Elizabeth H., the woman in the portrait Maud had just bought. He had met her once or twice, long ago. She might have been the one at the casino. Perhaps he had unconsciously recognized her--that would explain her effect on him. Hearing Wally returning, he noted her room number. </p><p>After a minute spent sipping his high ball, Allan said he was going to the john. Out of sight, he entered the honeyed glow of the carpeted stair. On the third floor he turned right. He had no plans. Behind one wall a pipe produced a spasmodic whine. Unless, Allan thought, a chipmunk was trapped in the old timbers; the sound struck him as animal. He counted door numbers until he reached Elizabeth's. </p><p>The whine was coming through that door. He pressed his ear to the wood. The voice sang waveringly on, needling Allan like a stuck car horn. He tried the doors of the adjacent rooms. The one on the right opened, and he entered a dark bedroom where light from the street revealed an empty bed. Crossing the room, Allan raised a window and leaned out. A ledge a foot wide ran across the building at floor level. From the window at his left faint light was shining. Gripping the window frame, Allan lowered both feet onto the ledge and slid along it. Reaching the light, he was confronted by backlighted blue shepherdesses strutting in a monotony of willows. The curtains allowed his sight no chink. Again, he heard the voice sustaining its reedy cantillation. In the lobby, when the woman had looked at him and then looked away, from the unbuttoned top of her dress one unhaltered breast had slipped and been tucked back smoothly into place. He had conceived her nakedness under the white cotton and the cinched belt buckled with golden snakes. </p><p>He looked down at the street--anyone there could see him--and began retracing his path. Downstairs, Wally waved him out into the fervent night. Allan was so astonished that if Maud had woken up when he came home, he might have told her everything that he had done. </p><p>In his letter, Allan wrote Elizabeth, "I kept wondering, was it really your room? Your voice? Who was with you? What exactly was he or she or they doing to you? I didn't want answers--I wanted you. I felt deprived."</p></p><h2>Fantastic Women: 18 Tales of the Surreal and the Sublime from Tin House</h2><p><p><strong>Featuring work by some of the most exciting contemporary women writers in the United States, Fantastic Women comprises eighteen inventive, insightful narratives steeped in a heady potion of surrealism and macabre black comedy.</strong></p> Meet the daughters of Franz Kafka, Mary Shelley, the Brothers Grimm, and Angela Carter.

But the introduction of gasoline, electric, and diesel shovels means big trouble for Mike and Mary Anne. No one wants an old-fashioned steam shovel like Mary Anne when a modern shovel can do the digging in half the time! Forced to travel far out of the city to look for work, Mike and Mary Anne find themselves in the little town of Popperville. Mike and Mary Anne make a bid to dig the cellar for the new town hall, promising the town that if they can't dig the cellar in just one day they'll accept no payment for the job. Will Mike and Mary Anne be able to complete the job? The whole town of Popperville turns out to watch. Virginia Lee Burton, author of such classic children's books as <i>The Little House</i> and <i>Katy and the Big Snow,</i> offers a touching portrait of love and dedication while commenting on the modernization that continuously shapes our lives. Hamilton's wonderful crayon drawings bring Mike and the indomitable Mary Anne to life. <i>(Ages 3 to 6)</i>Virginia Lee Burton (1909-1968) was the talented author and illustrator of some of the most enduring books ever written for children. The winner of the 1942 Caldecott Medal for THE LITTLE HOUSE, Burton&#39;s books include heroes and happy endings, lively illustrations, and a dash of nostalgia. She lived with her two sons, Aristides and Michael, and her husband George Demetrios, the sculptor, in a section of Gloucester, Massachusetts, called Folly Cove. Here she taught a class in design and from it emerged the Folly Cove designers, a group of internationally known professional artisans. She is the author of many classic children&#39;s picture books, including MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL and KATY AND THE BIG SNOW.</p><h2>I Have Crossed an Ocean: Selected Poems</h2><p>Grace Nichols&#39; poetry has a gritty lyricism that addresses the transatlantic connections central to the Caribbean-British experience. Her work brings a mythic awareness and a sensuous musicality that is at the same time disquieting. Born and educated in Guyana, Grace Nichols moved to Britain in 1977. I Have Crossed an Ocean is a comprehensive selection spanning some 25 years of her writing.</p><p>Born in Guyana, Grace Nichols has lived in Britain since 1977. Her first collection, I is a Long Memoried Woman (1983) won the Commonwealth Poetry Prize. Her later poetry collections - published by Virago - include The Fat Black Woman&#39;s Poems (1984), Lazy Thoughts of a Lazy Woman (1989), Sunris (1996), winner of the Guyana Prize, and Startling the Flying Fish (2006), poems which tell the story of the Caribbean, along with numerous poetry books for younger readers, including Come on into My Tropical Garden (1988), Give Yourself a Hug (1994) and Everybody Got a Gift (2005). She has published two books with Bloodaxe, her latest collection, Picasso, I Want My Face Back (2009), and I Have Crossed an Ocean: Selected Poems (2010), published on the occasion of her 60th birthday. She lives in Sussex with the poet John Agard and their family.&#39;Grace Nichols came to Britain from Guyana at the age of 27 and she has carried the warmth of her Caribbean sensibility through many a cold English winter. Her poems celebrate sensuality and generosity and attack petty mean-spiritedness - Deeply Caribbean in sensibility, she writes sensitively of other traditions, especially Africa and India&#39; - Peter Forbes, Contemporary Writers. &#39;From her first collection in 1983, &#34;I Is a Long Memoried Woman&#34;, she has been a strong presence in the linguistic interweave between the Caribbean and the UK. Her poetry and prose move easily between the poised world of Western culture, Old World history and myth, and the gritty rhythms of the Caribbean everyday - There is wit, irony and passion - real poise&#39; - Michelene Wandor, Poetry Review.</p><h2>You Can Learn to Remember: Change Your Thinking, Change Your Life (You Can...

Connell was one of the most popular American short story writers of his time. He had equal success as a journalist and screenwriter and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1942 for best original story.Ziggurat Productions employs multiple voices to tell this haunting classic short story about a hunter becoming the hunted. Accomplished big-game hunter Sanger Rainsford is washed ashore on a South American island owned by General Zaroff, a maniacal sportsman whose quarry is the two-legged kind. When Rainsford finds himself the prey of the madman, he must kill or be killed. The readings are quite good, and the story is enhanced by appropriately menacing music. The script sticks fairly close to the original tale, with only minor enhancements and additions, and a shift in the narrative voice.

He combined the Rinzai use of koans and the Soto emphasis on shikantaza in his teachings, influenced by his years studying under Hakuun Yasutani in the Harada-Yasutani school. He founded or co-founded several institutions and practice centers, including the Zen Center of Los Angeles, White Plum Asanga, Yokoji Zen Mountain Center, and the Zen Mountain Monastery. Taizan Maezumi left behind twelve Dharma successors, appointed sixty-eight priests and gave Buddhist precepts to more than five hundred practitioners. Along with Zen teachers like Shunryu Suzuki-roshi, Seung Sahn Dae Soen Sa Nim, and Venerable Hsuan Hua, Maezumi greatly influenced the American Zen landscape. Several Dharma Successors of his-including Tetsugen Bernard Glassman, Dennis Merzel, John Daido Loori, Jan Chozen Bays, Gerry Shishin Wick, Charlotte Joko Beck, and William Nyogen Yeo-have gone on to found Zen communities of their own. Maezumi died unexpectedly while visiting Japan in 1995.<br><br>Sensei Daishin was born in London, England, to a Jewish-Christian family of Eastern European backgrounds. He began Zen practice in Philadelphia in 1967, receiving both lay and Priest ordination in the Korean Chogye Order of Zen from the Venerable Seo Kyung-bo. He later practiced with (then) Maezumi Sensei at the Zen Center of Los Angeles (ZCLA), where he was in residence until 1979. He served as pastoral counselor, and was publishing editor of the <i>ZCLA Journal</i> and the <i>Zen Writings Series</i>. In 1999, Daishin renewed his Priest vows with Sensei Yoshin Jordan, and returned to ZCLA to study with Roshi Egyoku. In 2003 he received Preceptor Transmission and was empowered as Dharma Holder, and subsequently received Dharma Transmission in June 2008. Sensei Daishin has a PsyD in Psychology from the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute. He is a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist with a private clinical practice. He leads an affiliated sitting group, the Ocean Moon Sangha, in Santa Monica and teaches Buddhist psychology and zazen to mental health professionals.

He is married to Concetta Getsuren Alfano, a Zen practitioner, psychoanalyst and co-founder of the Center for Mindfulness and Psychotherapy. Daishin has one son."The Venerable Taizan Maezumi Roshi's teaching has caused true Zen to penetrate into people's minds and has cut through the trappings of their ego-oriented intentions.

Before a Christian can realize a consistent victorious spiritual life some basic truths must be understood: 1) the riches given by God at salvation to live Christ-like; 2) who the spiritual enemies are and how they attack; 3) and how to utilize divine enabling when resisting the enemies in order to live a successful Christian life. The Christian has three spiritual enemies: Satan, the world system and the sin nature. Dr. Schafer uses Scripture to identify these adversaries and how to access God&#39;s provisions for the strength to be victorious over them. This expository study of the Word is dedicated to Dr. Schafer&#39;s lifelong desire for saints to live Christ-like. H. LaVern Schafer served the Lord in several capacities for over 65 years as a Christian. He was pastor for 53 years, seminary professor for 44 years, and director of Dispensational Theological Seminary for 28 years. He earned his Doctorate of Theology from Dallas Theological Seminary, where his class was one of the last taught by Dr. Lewis Sperry Chafer. Dr. Schafer practiced a literal interpretation of Scripture. He believed that God&#39;s Word is meant to be interpreted literally to determine the exact concepts God is communicating and not what the reader wishes the Word to say. This desire resulted in a dispensational approach while interpreting Scripture with a historical linguistic treatment of the original text. His Christian Life series of booklets have been a blessing to thousands of believers. He went home to be with the Lord in 2008.</p><p></p><h2>Urn Burial (Miss Fisher&#39;s Murder Mysteries, 8)</h2><p><p><strong>Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, now streaming on Netflix, starring Essie Davis as the honourable Phryne Fisher</strong></p><p>"Another Down Under adventure that's definitely a cut above." &#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p><p>The redoubtable Phryne Fisher is holidaying at Cave House, a Gothic mansion in the heart of Australia's Victorian mountain country. But the peaceful surroundings mask danger. Her host is receiving death threats, lethal traps are set without explanation, and the parlour maid is found strangled to death. What with the reappearance of mysterious funerary urns, a pair of young lovers, an extremely eccentric swagman, an angry outcast heir, and the luscious Lin Chung, Phryne's attention has definitely been caught. Her search for answers takes her deep into the dungeons of the house and into the limestone Buchan caves. What will she find this time?</p></p><p><p>Kerry Greenwood was born in the Melbourne suburb of Footscray and after wandering far and wide, she returned to live there. She has degrees in English and Law from Melbourne University and was admitted to the legal profession on the 1st April 1982, a day which she finds both soothing and significant. Kerry has written three series, a number of plays, including <em>The Troubadours</em> with Stephen D'Arcy, is an award-winning children's writer and has edited and contributed to several anthologies. The Phryne Fisher series (pronounced Fry-knee, to rhyme with briny) began in 1989 with <em>Cocaine Blues</em> which was a great success. Kerry has written twenty books in this series with no sign yet of Miss Fisher hanging up her pearl-handled pistol. Kerry says that as long as people want to read them, she can keep writing them. In 2003 Kerry won the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Australian Association.</p>Those who like their mysteries bold and spicy will appreciate the latest adventure of 1920s heroine Phryne Fisher--the most erotic to date. Although Greenwood often describes loves scenes between Phryne and her handsome Chinese lover, Lin Chung, this time the action doesn't stop there. In fact, while taking a holiday at Cave House in Australia's Victorian mountain country, Phryne has her hands full. The racist innkeeper's wife has separated Phryne from Lin, who is placed at the other end of the house. To console herself, Phryne dabbles with a sexy young man. And while stealing a heated moment with Lin in the dark boathouse, Phryne hears a male couple obviously engaged in the same activity right near them. Aside from all the hanky-panky, a mystery does occur: the inn's owner is targeted by an enemy--first with notes, then with lethal traps. And someone is leaving funeral urns for Phryne--what are they trying to tell her? Another Down Under adventure that's definitely a cut above. <i>Jenny McLarin</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><h2>Good Grief</h2><p><b>In this "funny, fresh, and utterly believable" <i>New York Times</i> bestseller, a young woman struggles to build a new life after the death of her husband (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>). </b><br>36-year-old Sophie Stanton loses her young husband to cancer. In an age where women are expected to be high-achievers, Sophie desperately wants to be a good widow -- a graceful, composed Jackie Kennedy kind of widow. Alas, Sophie is more of a Jack Daniels kind. Downing cartons of ice cream for breakfast, breaking down in the produce section of supermarkets, showing up to work in her bathrobe and bunny slippers. Soon, she's not only lost her husband, but her job and her waistline as well. <br>In a desperate attempt to reinvent her life, Sophie moves to Ashland, Oregon. But instead of the way it's depicted in the movies, with a rugged Sam Shepherd kind of guy finding her, Sophie finds herself in the middle of Lucy-and-Ethel madcap adventures with a darkly comic edge. Still, Sophie proves that with enough humor and chutzpah, it is possible to have life after loss.</p><p>Some widows face their loss with denial. Sophie Stanton's reaction is one of pure bafflement. "How can I be a widow?" Sophie asks at the opening of Lolly Winston's sweet debut novel, <i>Good Grief</i>. "I'm only thirty-six. I just got used to the idea of being married." Sophie's young widowhood forces her to do all kinds of crazy things--drive her car through her garage door, for instance. That's on one of the rare occasions when she bothers to get out of bed. The Christmas season especially terrifies her: "I must write a memo to the Minister of Happier Days requesting that the holidays be cancelled this year." But widowhood also forces her to do something very sane. After the death of her computer programmer husband, she reexamines her life as a public relations agent in money-obsessed Silicon Valley. Sophie decides to ease her grief, or at least her loneliness, by moving in with her best friend Ruth in Ashland, Oregon. But it's her difficult relationship with psycho teen punker Crystal, to whom she becomes a Big Sister, that mysteriously brings her at least a few steps out of her grief. Winston allows Sophie life after widowhood: The novel almost indiscernibly turns into a gentle romantic comedy and a quirky portrait of life in an artsy small town. At all stops on her journey from widow to survivor, Sophie is a lively, crabby, delightfully imperfect character. <i>--Claire Dederer</i>Warner Books is proud to present a witty, hilarious and poignant story of loss and redemption - and the debut of a wonderfully talented new voice.</p><h2>Introducing Mindfulness: A Practical Guide</h2><p><p>Mindfulness is about teaching yourself to be more aware of your body and your environment, more present in the here and now, more focused and able to make choices about where you direct your attention, and more accepting of yourself and other people.</p></p><p>Tessa Watt teaches mindfulness and is co-director of Being Mindful, which offers mindfulness training for the public and in organisations.

Music was at the heart of a new generation's rallying cry for love, peace and harmony - from small clubs to giant festivals like Woodstock. With men predictably dominating as musicians and performers, the women and girls backstage started to explore their own forms of liberation and self-expression.

The concept breaks down in the introductions: Professor Dumbledore explains that the books are being offered to muggles (because the proceeds of the books are going to British charity Comic Relief, a disclosure that will raise the eyebrows of any reader who undestands the importance of secrecy in the wizard world.

Arguing that the music underwent its full creative evolution in little more than twenty-five years, he traces its roots from the jump blues of the forties to the disc jockeys who broadcast the music in the early fifties. He shows how impresarios such as Alan Freed and movie directors such as Richard Brooks (of <i>Blackboard Jungle)</i> joined black music to white fantasies of romance and rebellion, and then mass-marketed the product to teenagers. He describes how rock matured as a form of music, from Chuck Berry and Elvis Presley to the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Marvin Gaye, defining a decade of rebellious ferment. At the same time, he candidly recounts how trendsetting rock acts from Jim Morrison and the Doors in the late sixties to the Sex Pistols in the late seventies became ever more crude, outrageous, and ugly -- "as if to mark," writes Miller, "the triumph of the psychopathic adolescent." <br> Richly anecdotal and always provocative, <i>Flowers in the Dustbin</i> tells the story of rock and roll as it has never been told before.</p><p>It appears that <i>Flowers in the Dustbin</i> author James Miller has just about had his fill of rock &amp; roll. After chronicling a succession of triumphs in the development of the genre and its allied ancestors and offspring, here the veteran music scribe and editor of the superb first edition of <i>The Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &amp; Roll</i> surveys an environment tainted by "the Muzak of the Millennium" and "artifacts of stunning ugliness" (exemplified by Marilyn Manson and Wu-Tang Clan). Miller ponders, "What if rock and roll, as it had evolved from Presley to U2, had destroyed the very musical sources of its own vitality?" The erudite yet eminently readable author doesn't answer his query in these pages, but he does prompt a longing for a time when pop culture moved too fast and impulsively to be processed and packaged.<p> Miller makes it his mission to tell the story of the "explosive growth" of rock &amp; roll by recounting creative and commercial breakthroughs, dating from Wynonie Harris's 1947 recording of the jump-blues hit "Good Rockin' Tonight" through the last-gasp mutiny of the Sex Pistols and the death of Elvis Presley in 1977. In between, the development of top-40 radio begets the payola scandal of the '50s, Norman Mailer's "white Negro" becomes the model in a line of ever-more-self-conscious mavericks, and the 1960s trinity of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan pile remarkable musical and lyrical innovations atop one another like gifted children eager for attention. Once rock had reached its zenith, from the author's perspective, it didn't so much crumble as settle into regurgitated mush. That Miller is able to chronicle these dour developments in such an involving manner is testimony to his talent as a writer and historian, and to the thrill of rock &amp; roll when it's right. <i>--Steven Stolder</i></p><b>James Miller</b> is professor of political science and director of liberal studies at the Graduate Faculty of the New School for Social Research. A Guggenheim Fellow and twice a winner of the ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award for excellence in writing about music, he has covered the rock scene for national publications since 1967, when one of his early record reviews appeared in the third issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine. Since then, his reviews, profiles, and essays on music have appeared in <i>New Times, The New Republic, The New York Times,</i> and <i>Newsweek,</i> where he was a book reviewer and pop music critic between 1981 and 1990.

They feel the culture changing around them, and they fear that their beliefs will soon be marginalized as a form of bigotry. Others, younger Christians in particular, are tired of the culture wars, and they wonder whether courtroom battles are truly worthwhile, or even in line with the teachings of Jesus. Luke Goodrich offers a reasoned, balanced, gospel-centered approach to religious freedom. He applies biblical understanding to a number of the most hot-button cultural issues of our day. He also offers practical steps Christians can take to respond to religious freedom conflicts in an informed, responsible, and graceful way.</p><p>LUKE GOODRICH is a leading religious freedom attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, where he has won multiple Supreme Court victories for clients like the Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby. He frequently discusses religious freedom on networks such as Fox News, CNN, ABC, and NPR, and in publications like the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Time magazine. Goodrich is also an adjunct professor at the University of Utah law school, where he teaches an advanced course in constitutional law. He lives in Salt Lake City where he enjoys exploring the outdoors with his wife and family and serving in their local church.<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p><br>No one told me the lawyers&#x2019; table in the Supreme Court is so close to the justices.

Our team had spent months preparing our legal arguments. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> called it one of the &#x201c;most important religious liberty cases in a half century.&#x201d; Now we were finally in front of the justices, and no one knew how the case would end.</p><p>But I knew how it began&#x2014;with a simple disagreement that could happen at any church.</p><p>This time it was Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church in Redford, Michigan.

But when parents complained, the school hired a replacement teacher and asked Perich to consider taking the rest of the semester off and returning to work the following school year.</p><p>Perich wasn&#x2019;t happy. She presented a doctor&#x2019;s note saying she was cleared for work, showed up at school, and demanded her job back. When the school explained that it couldn&#x2019;t just fire the replacement teacher, Perich threatened to sue the church.</p><p>This behavior was deeply troubling to the church. Perich had a long-standing relationship with the church, and she knew they had no lawyer and no money. More importantly, she knew they were a <i>church</i>&#x2014;a group of Christians who are supposed to love one another, not sue one another.</p><p>Unable to reconcile with Perich, the school board met with church leadership. Together they met with the congregation and Perich. After much prayer and discussion, the congregation voted to remove Perich from her teaching position.</p><p>It was a hard decision, with hurt feelings on both sides. But it wasn&#x2019;t an unusual decision. Churches have to make hard decisions like this all the time. Most of the time, people move on and life returns to normal. But this time life didn&#x2019;t return to normal: Perich sued the church.</p><p>Perich claimed the church had discriminated against her by not letting her return to work immediately and by firing her when she threatened to sue. She demanded her job back, along with hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages and attorneys&#x2019; fees.</p><p>In response, the church said Perich was no longer qualified to be a teacher because she had threatened to sue the church in violation of 1 Corinthians 6:1&#x2013;8, which instructs Christians not to sue one another in secular court. It also argued it would be unconstitutional for a court to force the church to employ a teacher who had violated church teaching.</p><p>By the time the case reached the Supreme Court, the stakes couldn&#x2019;t have been higher. The case was no longer about a small Lutheran church in Michigan; it was about the freedom of <i>all </i>churches to choose their leaders in accordance with their beliefs. Could a church be sued for discrimination if it hired only male pastors? Could a Christian school be sued for discrimination if it dismissed a teacher for having an extramarital affair?</p><p>These are the kinds of questions the justices debated as we sat among the Supreme Court&#x2019;s massive marble pillars.</p><p><br><b>Food for Thought</b></p><p>Before I tell you the outcome, I&#x2019;d like you to consider a few questions:</p><p>First, have you heard of this case before? It was decided in 2012 and is one of the most important religious freedom cases in a generation, yet most Christians haven&#x2019;t heard of it. Why do you think that is?</p><p>Second, how do you think the case should turn out? And, more importantly, how would you explain your answer to a skeptical friend?</p><p>As for the first question, most Christians haven&#x2019;t heard of the case because they&#x2019;re busy with other important things&#x2014;family, work, school, church, and so forth&#x2014;and don&#x2019;t have time to follow every new religious freedom case. What they know about religious freedom comes mostly from what they hear in the news, see on social media, or learn from family and friends. Religious freedom is not their top priority.</p><p>As for the second question&#x2014;how should the case turn out and why?&#x2014;many Christians would struggle to give a confident answer. Some instinctively side with the teacher because she lost her job and claims to be a victim of discrimination&#x2014;and we all know discrimination is bad. Others tend to side with the church because, well, it&#x2019;s the church. Most have a hard time explaining who should win and why it matters.</p><p>These responses are neither surprising nor unreasonable. Religious freedom is only one of many important issues affecting our lives, and we can&#x2019;t be experts on everything.</p><p>But this also means most Christians are very poorly informed about religious freedom. We may have been told that the Supreme Court removed prayer from public schools or that there is yet another lawsuit challenging a nativity scene at Christmas. We may have heard that a county clerk got in trouble for refusing to issue same-sex marriage licenses or that a baker was sued for refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. But most of this information comes to us as mere background noise. We have a vague sense that religious freedom conflicts are increasingly common and that maybe we should start paying more attention, but we don&#x2019;t know where to start.</p><p>As long as life keeps humming along normally and we never face a violation of our religious freedom, our inattention won&#x2019;t be a problem. But if things change&#x2014;if our culture shifts and we start facing violations of our religious freedom&#x2014;we&#x2019;ll be caught unprepared.</p><p><br><b>Among Christian Leaders</b></p><p>This point hit home when I attended a gathering of Christian leaders who were concerned about religious freedom&#x2014;pastors, theologians, university presidents, and ministry CEOs, many of them prominent leaders in the Christian world. We gathered as courts across the country were starting to legalize same-sex marriage.</p><p>The fear in the room was palpable. These leaders were <i>not </i>apathetic about religious freedom; they were on full alert. They had a deep sense of responsibility for the organizations they led and the people they served. They also had a deep sense of concern that our culture is changing and that the climate for religious freedom is deteriorating. Some of these leaders had already been confronted with religious freedom conflicts of their own: their organizations had been kicked off university campuses, penalized by local governments, or pilloried in the media.</p><p>Although these leaders were on high alert, they were also unprepared&#x2014;and they knew it. They asked basic, sometimes misguided questions. Few had solid answers. Most didn&#x2019;t know what legal risks they faced or how to prepare for them. Even among the pastors, many seemed to lack a theological understanding of religious freedom or the tools needed to equip their congregations for the challenges ahead.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t mean this as a criticism. It is simply a description of fact. When religious freedom is secure, we don&#x2019;t give it much thought&#x2014;just like when I had no children, I didn&#x2019;t give parenting much thought. But when I found out my wife was pregnant, I realized I&#x2019;d better start learning! Otherwise I&#x2019;d be unprepared.</p><p>Many Christians are now in the same position. We&#x2019;ve long lived in a country where religious freedom was secure, and we didn&#x2019;t need to give it much thought. Now we&#x2019;re realizing the country is changing and we might not enjoy the same degree of religious freedom forever. If we don&#x2019;t start thinking about it now, we&#x2019;ll be unprepared.</p><p><br><b>Getting Prepared</b></p><p>That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;ve written this book. Our culture is changing. Religious freedom is not as secure as it once was. And the church is unprepared.</p><p>What can we do about it?</p><p>As I spoke with the gathering of Christian leaders, I realized the pastors, theologians, university presidents, and ministry CEOs in the room felt ill-equipped to help the church prepare. They were just waking up to the issue themselves.</p><p>This reminded me of what C. S. Lewis once said about church leadership on social issues. He wrote that people often want the church to take the lead: &#x201c;But, of course, when they ask for a lead from the Church most people mean they want the clergy to put out a political programme. That is silly.... We are asking them to do a quite different job for which they have not been trained.&#x201d;</p><p>Instead, Lewis said, &#x201c;the job is really on us, on the laymen. The application of Christian principles, say, to trade unionism and education, must come from Christian trade unionists and Christian schoolmasters; just as Christian literature comes from Christian novelists and dramatists&#x2014;not from the bench of bishops getting together and trying to write plays and novels in their spare time.&#x201d;</p><p>The same is true of religious freedom. The clergy has a crucial role to play in equipping the faithful and walking with them through difficult times. Yet to understand religious freedom at a deep level and to help prepare the church for the challenges ahead, we also need Christians who are steeped in the field of religious freedom.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve been steeped in nothing but religious freedom for over a decade, serving as an attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the nation&#x2019;s only law firm dedicated to protecting religious freedom for people of all faiths. During that time, I&#x2019;ve helped win four Supreme Court cases and many more lower court cases. I&#x2019;ve taught and debated religious freedom at universities and on television. I&#x2019;ve published articles about religious freedom in academic journals and newspapers. Most importantly, I&#x2019;ve walked with faithful, courageous Christians and people of other faiths through some of the most difficult trials of their lives.</p><p>My hope is that this experience can be used to help the church understand religious freedom at a deeper level and prepare for the challenges ahead.</p><p><br><b>A Plan</b></p><p>Based on many conversations with Christians over the years, I believe we have three primary needs that must be met before we&#x2019;re fully prepared.</p><p>First, we need a theology of religious freedom. Too often we begin thinking about religious freedom as a legal, cultural, or political problem without first recognizing that it is a theological problem. Our thinking about religious freedom must be grounded first in the truth of God as revealed in Scripture. You might be surprised at how much Scripture has to say about religious freedom. So part 1 of this book offers a theological understanding of religious freedom, drawing on the doctrine of God, the doctrine of man, and examples of religious freedom conflicts in Scripture.</p><p>Second, we need to understand the unique religious freedom challenges of our current culture. Our challenges today are different from the religious freedom challenges of fifteen years ago and different from those in other countries. We can&#x2019;t be prepared for our challenges if we don&#x2019;t understand what they are. Thus, part 2 applies our theology of religious freedom to the five most pressing religious freedom challenges in modern culture: (1) religious discrimination, (2) abortion rights, (3) gay rights, (4) Islam, and (5) the public square. As a lawyer on the front lines in these conflicts, I&#x2019;ll explain what the key legal problems are, how they can be resolved, and what Christians can expect from our legal system in the coming years.</p><p>Finally, we need to take action. Our faith is not a set of abstract principles; it&#x2019;s a calling covering every aspect of our lives. How should we, as Christians, live our daily lives when religious freedom is under threat? What can we do about it?</p><p>American Christians haven&#x2019;t faced serious violations of their religious freedom for a long time, but much of Scripture was written to Christians who were facing just that. To live our faith in modern culture, we need to reclaim and reacquaint ourselves with what Scripture says to the persecuted church. Thus, part 3 is practical. Drawing on Scripture&#x2019;s message to the persecuted church, it addresses how Christians should live when religious freedom is under threat.</p><p><br><b>A Final Word</b></p><p>Before we begin, I should tell you how the Supreme Court case involving the teacher and the church turned out.</p><p>We won&#x2014;unanimously. The court ruled that churches must be free to choose &#x201c;who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission.&#x201d; The decision stands as one of the greatest religious freedom victories in the last fifty years.</p><p>In that spirit, I want to begin with a word of hope.</p><p>When I met with that gathering of Christian leaders, they were burdened by fear. They felt the culture changing around them, and they were worried about the serious religious freedom challenges ahead. Even now you can find any number of Christian books and blogs that play on these fears, warning that our culture is lost and that our rights will soon vanish.</p><p>But that is not this book. This is a book of hope, not fear.</p><p>Why?</p><p>As Americans, we can be tempted to place our hope in human institutions. Compared with the rest of the world, we have a stable legal system with broad constitutional guarantees of religious freedom. We have laws that protect our freedom to worship, to evangelize, to found Christian ministries, and to run businesses in accordance with our faith. Our Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled in favor of religious freedom. We think if we can just preserve those institutions...win the next election...get the right Supreme Court justices appointed...then we have hope.</p><p>But that kind of hope is hollow. As soon as we lose an election or lose a big case, that hope is replaced by fear.</p><p>And what about Christians elsewhere? As I write this, Christians in China face harassment, arrest, and imprisonment for worshipping in the underground church. Christians in Egypt risk death at the hands of suicide bombers who target their churches. Christians from Iraq and Syria are fleeing genocide at the hands of Islamist militants. Christians throughout history have suffered terrible persecution. Yet Scripture calls <i>all </i>of us to &#x201c;rejoice in hope&#x201d; (Romans 5:2), whether we live in North America or North Africa. Where does that hope come from?</p><p>That hope is not rooted in any human institution. It is not rooted in fair laws, favorable election results, or friendly Supreme Court justices. It is rooted in a person: Jesus Christ. He has already conquered every enemy we&#x2019;ll ever face, and He has promised us an imperishable inheritance in heaven. So even when we&#x2019;re &#x201c;grieved by various trials,&#x201d; we still &#x201c;rejoice with joy that is inexpressible&#x201d; (1 Peter 1:6&#x2013;8).<br></p></p><h2>National Rhythms, African Roots: The Deep History of Latin American Popular Dance (Di�logos Series)</h2><p><p>When John Charles Chasteen learned that Sim?n Bol�var, the Liberator, danced on a banquet table to celebrate Latin American independence in 1824, he tried to visualize the scene. How, he wondered, did the Liberator dance? Did he bounce stiffly in his dress uniform? Or did he move his hips? In other words, how high had African dance influences reached in Latin American societies? A vast social gap separated Bol�var from people of African descent; however, Chasteen's research shows that popular culture could bridge the gap.</p><p>Fast-paced and often funny, this book explores the history of Latin American popular dance before the twentieth century. Chasteen first focuses on Havana, Buenos Aires, and Rio de Janeiro, where dances featuring a "transgressive close embrace" (forerunners of today's salsa, tango, and samba) emerged by 1900. Then, digging deeper in time, Chasteen uncovers the historical experiences that molded Latin American popular dance, including carnival celebrations, the social lives of slaves, European fashions, and, oddly enough, religious processions. The relationship between Latin American dance and nationalism, it turns out, is very deep, indeed.</p></p><p>John Chasteen examines the history behind sexually suggestive dances (salsa, samba, and tango) that brought people of different social classes and races together in Latin America.John Charles Chasteen is professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><h2>The Inheritance: And Other Stories</h2><p><p> A treasure trove of tales from a master storyteller�the first to feature works written under both her pseudonyms, Robin Hobb and Megan Lindholm . . . </p> <p> <i>The Inheritance</i> </p> <p> Before she became an acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, Robin Hobb received resounding critical praise for work written under the name Megan Lindholm. Though they spring from the same imagination, Hobb and Lindholm are separate, diverse identities, each with her own unique style and perspective. </p> <p> <i>The Inheritance</i> celebrates the boundless vision of Hobb and Lindholm, bringing together for the first time classic and new short works from both names. The collection is comprised of three generous offerings from Robin Hobb, including the title story, which makes its U.S. debut here, and a brand-new tale, "Cat's Meat." Megan Lindholm contributes her Hugo and Nebula Award finalist "A Touch of Lavender" and Nebula finalist "Silver Lady and the Fortyish Man," as well as several classic and new gems. </p> <p> Each piece is prefaced by a brief yet informative author's note, offering insight into each story's genesis. Fascinating, compelling, and wonderfully entertaining, <i>The Inheritance</i> reveals the full spectrum of skill and talent of one of the world's finest fantasy writers. </p></p><p>Megan Lindholm (Wizard of the Pigeons) writes tightly constructed SF and fantasy with a distinctly contemporary feel. Robin Hobb (Assassin's Quest) writes sprawling, multi-volume fantasies set in imaginary realms. These two writers, apparently so different, are, of course, the same person, each reflecting an aspect of a single multifaceted imagination.Inheritance gathers the best of Hobb and Lindholm's shorter fiction into one irreplaceable volume containing ten stories and novellas (seven by Lindholm, three by Hobb), together with a revealing introduction and extensive, highly readable story notes. The Lindholm section leads off with the Hugo and Nebula-nominated novella &#x201c;A Touch of Lavender,&#x201d; a powerful account of love, music, poverty, and addiction set against an extended encounter between human and alien societies. Other memorable entries include &#x201c;Cut,&#x201d; a reflection on the complex consequences of freedom, and the newly published &#x201c;Drum Machine,&#x201d; an equally absorbing meditation on the chaotic nature of the creative impulse. Two of Robin Hobb's contributions revisit the world of her popular Live Traders series. &#x201c;Homecoming&#x201d; enlarges the earlier history of those novels through the journal entries of Lady Carillion Carrock, while &#x201c;The Inheritance&#x201d; concerns a disenfranchised young woman who comes to understand the true nature of her grandmother's legacy. And in &#x201c;Cat's Meat,&#x201d; a long and wonderful story written expressly for this collection, an embattled single mother reclaims her life with the help of a gifted&#x2014;and utterly ruthless&#x2014;cat.Inheritance offers the best of two separate but related fictional worlds. Whatever their differences, the Hobb and Lindholm stories have certain crucial elements in common: their intelligence, their attention to detail, and their instant, almost effortless accessibility. Together, these beautifully crafted tales constitute a unique&#x2014;and important&#x2014;collection that offers both offers both intellectual pleasure and pure narrative excitement on virtually every page.<p>Robin Hobb was born in California but grew up in Alaska.

Architectural ceramic decoration is one of the most celebrated<br>manifestations of the arts of Islam. Spanning a period from the<br>13th to the 20th century, the tiles featured in this book exhibit<br>a rich range of influences from Persia, Turkey, China and even<br>Europe. A renowned specialist in the fields of Islamic and<br>Indian art, Arthur Millner explores the historical context that<br>allowed the uniquely creative achievement of Syrian craftsmen<br>to flourish, and why tiles from this region are less restricted<br>in artistic expression than those from better-known centers<br>of production. The complex and interconnected nature of tile<br>designs, techniques and color palettes is explored, highlighting<br>what is distinctive about Damascus ceramics and how they<br>relate to tiles produced in other parts of the Islamic world.<br>Finally, the author traces the journey made by many of these<br>tiles to the West, embellishing the interiors of wealthy clients as<br>Islamic art became both fashionable and influential in late-19thcentury<br>art and design.</p><p>Arthur Millner is a specialist consultant in Islamic and Indian art. After working as head of Indian, Himalayan and South East Asian auctions at Sotheby&#39;s in London, he later opened a gallery in Kensington. More recently he has returned to organizing auctions, as well as writing and lecturing on Indian and Islamic art.</p><h2>A Slip of a Girl</h2><p><b><b>A heart-wrenching novel in verse about a poor girl surviving the Irish Land Wars, by a two-time Newbery Honor-winning author.</b></b><br><br>For Anna, the family farm has always been home...

"He doesn't look dangerous to you?" One eyebrow arched, telling her he found her reaction amusing, but she couldn't begin to guess why, and she'd worked with him long enough to know he wouldn't explain even if she asked. With short dark hair and green, gold-flecked eyes, he had the face of a sensitive man who'd become cynical and the body of a soldier. Nate was a tempting physical specimen. But he wasn't one to reveal much about his thoughts.<br><br>Rachel wished that was <em>all </em>she knew about her boss. When she'd first started working at Department 6 eight months ago, she'd been so convinced she'd met the one man she could love with all her heart, she'd made a humiliating miscalculation. The embarrassment of that incident still burned so intensely she could barely look at him.<br><br>Ignoring the way his T-shirt stretched over his clearly defined pecs, she kept her focus on Ethan Wycliff, the man in the picture. Wiry and with the appearance of some height, Ethan had polish to spare&#x2014;high cheekbones, black hair, black eyes and a beguiling smile. "He's too pretty to seem dangerous. He could be on billboards, modeling suits for Armani. What's he done?"<br><br>Except for possibly height, Nate was Ethan's opposite. Although he wasn't overweight by any stretch of the imagination, slender wasn't an adjective that came to mind. Pretty and polished didn't fit, either. He was handsome, but not in the classic sense of movie stars and models. His forehead was a bit too wide, his jaw too square. And he had too many scars&#x2014;both from when he was a navy SEAL and from working for Department 6 after he'd left the military.<br><br>"Depends on who you talk to," he said. "There's a chance that none of it's illegal, but the secrecy surrounding him and his group is making some important people nervous."<br><br>Rachel shoved the picture back in Nate's direction, but he didn't move to reclaim it. He let Ethan Wycliff's image remain on the table, eyes staring sightlessly at the ceiling of the small conference room&#x2014;one of several in the L.A. office. Unlike other security contractors, Department 6 rarely handled military operations. They specialized in undercover work, generally inside the U.S.<br><br>"What's he <em>suspected </em>of doing?" she asked. "Laundering money? Smuggling drugs? Working in the sex-slave trade?"<br><br>"He's the leader of a religious cult about two hundred members strong."<br><br>That was the last thing she'd expected Nate to say. Judging by Ethan's elegant business suit, he had taste. He wasn't sporting a scraggly beard, wasn't beggarly or odd-looking in any way. Neither did he appear smarmy like some televangelists she'd seen. Not in the photograph, anyway. "What kind of religious cult?"<br><br>"A Christian cult. Sort of. It seems to be a compilation of whatever Ethan wants it to be. He and his followers call their organization the Church of the Covenant. One thing they believe is that the world is coming to an end very soon. Only those who are properly branded&#x2014;"<br><br>"You mean, tattooed?" she cut in.<br><br>"No, I mean, <em>branded</em>&#x2014;and baptized and living within the gates of their little commune&#x2014;will rule with God."<br><br>"That's not particularly creative." She'd heard plenty of the same rhetoric in her own house growing up. For most of her life her father and the leaders of his small sect had claimed that the world was in its "last days." They'd named date after date when Armageddon would arrive. Every one had come and gone. "How'd he get his start?"<br><br>"Five years ago, he was a popular frat boy at Cornell. I guess he and a few roommates went out in the woods and devised their own religion, loosely based on the Old Testament's patriarchal order. Our intelligence report indicates that it was originally meant to be a joke. Drugs were involved. They called it the 'antireligion.'<br><br>But when they began meeting regularly, word spread among the kids at Cornell and other colleges in nearby communities, somehow generating support, and it became real."<br><br>"Power is tough to resist, especially for an Ivy League frat boy who's used to being on top of the world."<br><br>"That's my take, too."<br><br>She glanced away from Nate so she wouldn't squirm in her seat at the memories that overwhelmed her whenever their eyes met. "How many of his roommates still belong to this so-called religion?"<br><br>"The original four are still with him. They're known as 'spiritual guides' now and they're part of the Brethren, the twelve men who form a close circle around him. A fifth roommate, one who joined a bit later, is dead."<br><br><em>"Dead?" </em>she echoed. "At twenty-something?"<br><br>"He was killed in a drunk-driving accident after a meeting. There are a few unanswered questions but no real proof that it was anything other than that."<br><br>She considered what she'd just been told. "What's so appealing about his religion that others are interested in joining up?"<br><br>"It's mostly familiar stuff but with a modern twist. It includes extramarital sex and drug use. And Wycliff has a few assets&#x2014;<em>besides his looks</em>&#x2014;that make him more dangerous than most cult leaders."<br><br>She ignored his reference to her appreciation of Wycliff's appearance and scooted closer to the table. But the instant she caught Nate's scent, that mix of clean male and leather that would forever differentiate him from every other man, the memory of slipping into his bed to "surprise" him came to her as vividly as the night she'd done it. Would the mortification <em>never </em>go away?<br><br>He gave her a speculative look, as if he could suddenly sense an added level of discomfort, but she was determined to pretend she'd forgotten all about her terrible faux pas. As a child, she'd been sheltered so long she hadn't grown up with the usual interplay between the sexes and, apparently, hadn't read his signals correctly. She'd thought he wanted the same thing.<br><br>Keeping her gaze steady, she struggled, once again, to forget that night. "And those assets are..."<br><br>"More charisma than any man has a right to, at least a man who once idolized Charles Manson."<br><br>"Charles <em>Manson? A</em>re you serious?"<br><br>He chose a file from a stack he'd brought in with him, and thumbed through it while he talked. "Dead serious. Wycliff corresponded with Manson regularly while he was in high school. I've got copies of some of those letters here."<br><br>"Was their correspondence a joke at first, too?"<br><br>"He played it that way, used to read Manson's letters aloud to various people he knew, including his parents. His mother said he liked the shock value. His father claims he's always been fascinated with killers. Especially Manson, because of the brutality of the Tate murders and the power Manson held over those who committed them."<br><br>"Why would they allow him to correspond with someone like Manson?"<br><br>"It started out as what Ethan called 'a psychological study.' He said he wanted to major in behavioral science when he went to college."<br><br>She shivered. "But couldn't they see where it was going? These letters make me more than a little nervous."<br><br>"They should've made everyone nervous." He offered the file for her perusal.<br><br>Careful not to brush his hand, she accepted it but merely placed it in front of her, because he was still talking.<br><br>"At first his parents saw only what they wanted to see and hoped his interest was professional, as he'd claimed. He didn't read them what <em>he </em>wrote to Manson. He kept that private, so the bits and pieces they heard of Manson's letters made it sound as if Manson was the only crazy one."<br><br>"So how did we get copies of the letters?"<br><br>"You know how closely prison mail is monitored. Once his father finally became uneasy, he paid a correctional officer to keep an eye on the budding relationship. It was that guy who made copies. But he worked certain days and shifts, of course, and the letters that came and went on someone else's watch were lost."<br><br>"Why didn't dear old dad put a stop to the letters once he saw what they contained?"<br><br>"His wife insisted it was just a 'phase' Ethan was going through, that he was purposely trying to provoke Manson, the same way he tried to provoke everyone else. And then the problem seemed to solve itself. Ethan grew disenchanted with Manson, quit writing him and the relationship ended."<br><br>"But that was a pretty ominous start, and it led to a bigger problem."<br><br>"Exactly. Now Ethan's set himself up as a prophet, the Holy One, the man to lead all Christians to enlightenment."<br><br>"And let me guess&#x2014;enlightenment happens <em>after </em>this life."<br><br>"With your background, I knew you'd be familiar with the dogma."<br><br>Far more than she wanted to be. She'd tried hard to distance herself from the brainwashing she'd undergone as a child, but it wasn't easy to put all those hours of religious "instruction" behind her. Not when there were so many lasting effects, some of which she blamed for the embarrassing blunder she'd made with Nate six months ago.<br><br>"Sounds as if he's as whacked as Manson," she mused. Or, like her father, his teachings and devotions could be similar enough to mainstream religions to fall within what society deemed "normal." Not that her father's "normal" was normal to most people. From the moment she got home from school every day, Fredrick Jessop had kept her under lock and key, forced her to read the Bible for hours on end and go to church three or four times a week. Until she'd left home at seventeen, he'd had complete control. Even after she was on her own, she'd been so well trained she was twenty-five before she lost her virginity; at that point she'd finally slept with a man just to punish her father after an argument. That had turned out to be such a bad experience, so cheap and unsatisfying, she hadn't had sex again until she met Nate. But, for different reasons, her encounter with Nate had been even more disappointing than the original one.<br><br>"He might be crazy," Nate said. "But making up your own religion isn't a crime. You know that better than most."<br><br>Her father and his cronies had done it, hadn't they? "So what law has Ethan broken?"<br><br>Nate's broad shoulders lifted in a shrug. "That's the reason for this assignment&#x2014;to find out."<br><br>She'd already assumed as much. But she wasn't comfortable with the religious element. Her background dealing with religious zealots had taught her there was no way to win, no way to argue any doctrine logically because people like her father always referred to the illogical to back up their beliefs.<br><br>"Do you think I have the experience for this?" she asked. Before coming to Department 6, she'd worked undercover for the LAPD, pretending to be a prostitute, as well as helping in some drug busts. Since hiring on at Department 6, she'd continued with drug enforcement, generally contract labor for the DEA. Bottom line, she'd specialized in something that was more straightforward, easier to fight. And she liked it that way.<br><br>"You have as much experience with this type of thing as anyone else at Department 6," he said.<br><br>That was probably true. They all did more drug work than anything else. "There must be <em>something </em>besides his affiliation with Manson that's brought this man to our attention," she said. "I'm guessing there are a lot of whack jobs who've contacted Manson over the years."<br><br>"A woman by the name of Martha Wilson recently escaped from the commune," Nate explained.<br><br><em>Now </em>they were talking. "Another interesting word choice, seeing that <em>escaped </em>has the connotation of being held against her will."<br><br><em>"Her </em>word," he said. "She claimed Wycliff punished her for sleeping with her own husband."<br><br>"I thought sex was dealt with in a more liberal fashion in this commune."<br><br>"It is. But she was on 'restriction.'"<br><br>Because it was beyond awkward to talk about sex with Nate after what had occurred between them, Rachel tried to cover her anxiety by toying with the edge of the file in front of her. "You're kidding."<br><br>"Nope. Otherwise, sex is open to anyone, married or unmarried, as long as both people are consenting and of age."<br><br>"Now I see why Ethan's attracting converts. Religious endorsement of drugs <em>and </em>sex. No willpower required. What's not to like?"<br><br>His lips quirked in a wry smile. "It's not quite as simple as it might sound."<br><br>"With religion, it never is," she muttered.<br><br>"Only those who live according to various 'higher laws'&#x2014;" he made quotation marks with his fingers "&#x2014;gain that benefit. But there's a cost. Once you join, you begin a process that culminates in embracing certain rituals that go with these laws. We're not sure what these rituals are. We got most of this information from what was reported in the papers. Martha was vocal about the group's abuse, but less so about their beliefs."<br><br>"And Milt can't get more information?" Milton Berger owned the company. Slightly eccentric, he was basically a wealthy businessman who'd never spent a day in the field. At forty-five, he drank and smoked so much he couldn't possibly run the forty-yard dash. But he had an eye for talent and a talent for making money.<br><br>"He's relying on us to figure out the rest."<br><br>"Do you know what the prize is?"<br><br>"The prize?" he repeated.<br><br>"What do the people in Ethan's religion get for living these supposed higher laws? There's always a prize for good behavior. It's usually called salvation."<br><br>"They're admitted into 'the Holy One's' inner sanctum and become sanctified like he is. Or something like that. Again, there might be more to it."<br><br>Remembering what she'd been taught regarding the few elect who would rule with God, she made a face. "How do people fall for this crap?" She'd been steeped in it and still couldn't buy it, although there'd been plenty of times she'd wished she could. It would've made her life so much easier.<br><br>"I think psychologists say they're not happy with the world in which they're living. Some want to prove how unique and special they are. Others are just hoping to feel as if they belong." He drummed his fingers on the table. "But who really knows? Motivations are as individual as people."<br><br>"Doesn't sound to me like the world they're building will be any better than the one we've got." No matter how hard her father and brother had tried to convince her that the afterlife was all that mattered. "How badly did Ethan Wycliff beat the woman who escaped?"<br><br>"She says it wasn't him. It was a public event&#x2014;a stoning modeled after those in the Bible."<br><br>She stiffened. "Stoning is a death sentence in the Bible."<br><br>"Martha managed to escape."<br><br>"How?"<br><br></p><h2>Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves (The Collector&#39;s Wodehouse)</h2><p>Launched on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, each Overlook Wodehouse is the finest edition of the master&#39;s work ever published.

Nanny Hazel Doss, killer of four husbands, three children, two sisters, and her mother--all to turn a profit. These are just two of the dozens of deadly and determined women who have been overlooked in the popular annals of serial crime--until now. More difficult to apprehend and motivated by more complex issues, female serial killers may be even more lethal and cunning than their male counterparts.</p><p>If you're haunted by the image of the manacled, wild-haired Aileen Wuornos facing the television cameras in her prison orange, don't be fooled. According to coauthors Michael and C.L. Kelleher, Wuornos is no freak of nature. <i>Murder Most Rare</i>, an earnest history, profiles nearly 100 fatal females that have knocked around since 1900, more than half of whom were, or are, Americans. And, contend the Kellehers, these deadly dames were "far more lethal-- and often far more successful in their determination to kill--than their male counterparts." The lone female serial killer is rarely motivated by sex, chooses a method difficult to detect (poison, simulated accident, suffocation), and selects victims with whom she has a relationship. To add to the charm, "she is often overlooked as a suspect because of her maturity or position of trusted responsibility." <p> What drives this husband-and-wife team to pursue the whys and wherefores of female serial killers? Partly vindication--the Kellehers condemn the entertainment and news industries for romanticizing and sensationalizing violent crime. Also, their text intends to set the record straight. Fact: serial killing is not confined to the Ted Bundy phenomenon; rather, it has a long historical reach that includes "the infamous exploits of the gunslinger of the old West, ... the unspeakable crimes of the Nazi leadership, ... the contemporary Mafia hit man." To this noxious blend must be added the women in this book. </p> <p> Black widows, angels of death, sexual predators, and team killers are, among others, some types of murderers, and each chapter describes the behaviors and methods unique to each. Marie Besnard, for example, the queen of poisoners (active in France from 1927 to 1949), was fully acquitted of all charges after three trials that spanned a period of more than 20 years. As the title suggests, <i>Murder Most Rare</i> offers up ripping yarns. Who wouldn't want to read about Nanny Hazel Doss, one of the more infamous black widows, christened by the press the Giggling Grandmother? Her successful "projects" included the deletion of four husbands, three children, two sisters, and her mother--and all to turn a profit. </p> <p> Written for the lay reader interested in a "forbidden" subject more often sensationalized than not, does <i>Murder Most Rare</i> leave us the wiser as to why women kill? Unfortunately, the case histories read more like bland recitations. The Kellehers venture no analyses or theories about how circumstances might have contributed to the shaping of the criminal mind. The sketches leave the reader with the impression that these female criminals sprung, like Athena, fully formed from the head of Zeus. For the tenacious tracking of creepy psychological insight and in-your-face investigation, stick with true- crime queen Ann Rule.</p><p>A fascinating, disturbing and thorough exploration of the shocking crimes and complex motivations of female serial killers.</p></p><h2>Wild Flowers of the Yukon, Alaska &amp; Northwestern Canada</h2><p>In recent years, more and more nature lovers have been flocking to discover the untouched serenity of the North.

Raised in Devon, the Isle of Jura, Scotland and Phillimore Gardens, London, educated at Bradfield School and Sandhurst College, John served with the British Eighth Army in the Second World War in Iraq, leading Assyrian levy troops, before entering the Italian campaign where he was seriously wounded and spent two years as a prisoner of war. Never one to avoid a challenge, he assumed many roles throughout his life including Master of the Hounds, Sandhurst; Captain in the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry; farm hand at Oyster River; bulb farmer at Cobble Hill; lighthouse keeper at Race Rocks; author; botanist; tour guide and gardener. John was an instructor in the Faculty of Biology at the University of Victoria for 18 years where he thrived on sharing his life-long love of plants. It was there he met Lewis Clark, whose great work, Wildflowers of British Columbia (revised as Wildflowers of the Pacific Northwest,) he edited after Clark's death. He authored Wildflowers of the Yukon and Alaska and spent his later years working on a history of the Assyrian people. In retirement he developed, with his wife Ruth, his garden at Deep Cove. John was happiest showing friends and visitors his beautiful and ever-expanding garden, which featured rare rhododendrons from many parts of the world. He also enjoyed participating in the development of the Finnerty Gardens at the University of Victoria and his commitment to learning culminated in the award of an honorary doctorate from the University of Victoria in.

More than that, in it Mark Jones offers a key&#x2014;a robust Reformed Christology with a strong emphasis on the Holy Spirit&#x2014;and chapter by chapter uses it to unlock nine questions raised by the debates.</p><p><b>Mark Jones</b> (PhD, Leiden University) is Senior Minister at Faith Vancouver Presbyterian Church (PCA) and Research Associate at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein, South Africa. He has written and edited several books and most recently coauthored <i>A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life.</i>"The problem of antinomianism is a hardy perennial for the church. There is a mischievous movement afoot at the moment whose soaring rhetoric about grace is matched by an equally casual presumption on the same. Mark Jones's book is thus to be welcomed: it is biblically grounded, historically sensitive, and above all timely. In addition, through his careful attention to the role of Christ in scripture and in historical Reformed confessional treatments of sanctification, Jones provides a significant supplement to other recent books pleading for a biblical emphasis on personal piety."<br><b>&#x2014;Carl R. Trueman, Paul Woolley Professor of Church History, Westminster Theological Seminary, PA; Pastor of Cornerstone Presbyterian Church (OPC) Ambler, PA</b><br><br>"We are living in a deeply encouraging day when the sovereignty of God's grace is being rediscovered far and wide. But, as has happened in the past, when such times of biblical ressourcement have occurred, the error of antinomianism has made its appearance. This new work by Mark Jones is thus a timely tract for the times. It is rich in scriptural argument, illustrations from church history, and vigorous application. May it have a wide reading and even wider heeding!"<br><b>&#x2014;Michael A.G. Haykin, Professor of Church History and Biblical Spirituality, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, KY</b><br><br>"Though in the popular imagination antinomianism is often simply identified with a denial of the positive role of God's moral law in the Christian life, Jones demonstrates that it includes a number of additional elements&#x2014;a belittling of Christ's example of holiness as a pattern for the Christian life (<i>imitatio Christi</i>); a diminishment of the law of God as a true means of sanctification; an unbalanced conception of the relationship between law and gospel; a reluctance to acknowledge the biblical emphasis upon rewards as a legitimate motive for Christian obedience; and a failure to recognize the role of good works as a secondary ground for the believer's assurance of salvation. However, the principal strength of Jones's argument against antinomianism resides in his emphasis upon the fullness of Christ s person and saving work. Jones shows how a proper understanding of the work of Christ includes both the gospel benefits of free justification and progressive sanctification. In doing so, Jones nicely exposes one of the ironies of antinomianism&#x2014;in the name of preserving the gospel, antinomianism typically truncates it."<br><b>&#x2014;Cornelis P. Venema, President, Professor of Doctrinal Studies, Mid-America Reformed Seminary</b><br><br>"What does a seventeenth century theological controversy have to do with Christian living in the twenty-first century? Everything. With the acumen of an historian and the heart of a pastor, Mark Jones deftly guides readers through one of the most tangled and most important set of issues facing the Reformed church.

This present day is no exception. The legalistic abuses of recent decades are now being replaced with a hyper-grace license to sin. Sad to say, portions of the Reformed community have given shelter to this new antinomianism, claiming that personal obedience to the Law of Christ is merely optional. Often trendy with 'the young, restless, and Reformed,' this toxic message is poisonous to the soul. In this excellent work, Mark Jones exercises considerable skill in exposing the fatal flaws of this anti-law, cheap-grace easy-believism. Throughout these pages you will find the theological clarity needed to reject the twisted errors of legalism and license and to embrace a true, grace-inspired, Spirit-empowered obedience to the Scripture."<br><b>&#x2014;Dr. Steven J.

(Will Nicoll <i>The Spectator</i>)<br><br>"In this intimate portrait of the country, he explains how the old regime--the last of the Eastern European communist regimes to fall--slowly crumbled and a democratic party, largely student-based, formed, faltered, and gave way to a transfigured communist party." (Robert Legvold,Foreign Affairs)<br><br>"The canon on modern Albanian political history in English is small but Fred Abraham's book is now a large contribution to it. Excellent and above all readable; anyone interested in contemporary Albanian and Balkan history should be grateful that he has committed his deep knowledge about the country, and above all its travails in the 1990s, to paper." (Tim Judah,author of Kosovo: War and Revenge)<br><br>"The book really shines when Abrahams presents the results of his scrupulous search for the few, brave souls who dared to raise protests against the communist regime." (<i>Transitions Online</i>)<br><br>"[Abrahams] account is useful for a number of reasons. For example, it clearly encourages questions about external involvement, especially the Wests decision 1) to tolerate corruption, authoritarian policies and monopolization of power for the sake of regional short-term stability, and 2) to get rid of regimes once they stop serving their own interests." (<i>Slavonic and East European Review</i>)<br><br>"[A]ssiduously researched, compulsively readable . . . Abrahams speaks the language, has read the documents, witnessed many of the key episodes for himself, and interviewed almost every player of significance. Albania is a country filled with wily, resourceful, worldly, funny, and fatalistic people, and with their many contributions Abrahamss narrative is as darkly farcical as it is tragic."

That's a good beginning--but how about taking it to the next level? Each of Fr. Kubicki's daily meditations is followed by a unique prayer of self-offering for each day of the year. These will help us to grasp what a great gift and glory it is to unite our daily ups and downs to the perfect sacrifice of Jesus. Even the busiest person could build a solid prayer life with this book." --<b>Daria Sockey</b>, Columnist for <i>Catholic Digest</i> and author of <i>The Everyday Catholic's Guide to the Liturgy of the Hours</i><br><br>"<i>A Year of Daily Offerings</i> is a marvelous tour through the Church's daily riches of saints and feasts by following her liturgical calendar.

Generations of Seattleites have fond memories of restaurants, local television shows, stores, and other landmarks that evoke a less sophisticated, more informal city.

These rare and vintage images hearken back to the marvels of the 1962 World's Fair, shopping trips to Frederick &amp; Nelson and I.

Inspired by that search, bestselling philosopher Haim Shapira muses on the perennial questions most relevant to our lives.<br><br>Ecclesiastes is among the most poetic books&nbsp;of the Old Testament, full of famous and&nbsp;resonant verses:&nbsp;'Vanity of vanities, all is vanity'; 'A time to weep and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance'; 'I have seen all the things that are done under the sun; all of them are meaningless, a chasing after the wind'.&nbsp;It is traditionally attributed to King Solomon (r. 970-930 BC), who&nbsp;advises us to avoid seeking happiness in worldly things and focus instead on the eternal truths.<br><br>The book poses many vital questions:&nbsp;Is life nonsense and suffering or bliss? Is there any meaning to our actions under the sun? What will happen at the end? Is there any advantage to wisdom? Why can't a just regime be established? What are the relationships between happiness and wealth? What is the source of emotions and what do we know about desires? Can knowledge of death serve as a guide to life?&nbsp;<br><br>King Solomon does not instruct us to think like him, nor does he guide us towards a particular path. Ecclesiastes sends us on a journey into The Valley of Great Questions: Abel, man, world, labor, advantage, sun, goodness, time, light, evil spirit, wisdom, love, fear of God, death, and more...<br><br>Haim Shapira's rich and rigorously&nbsp;informed&nbsp;analysis allows King&nbsp;Solomon's voice to speak to us across the&nbsp;millennia, offering remarkably up-to-the-minute insights for people of all faiths and none. If you want advice about living a better life (and to learn about the meaning of life), would it not be wise to receive&nbsp;it from King Solomon&nbsp;&#x2013;&nbsp;the wisest man of all time?</p><p>Haim Shapira was born in Lithuania in 1962 and immigrated to Israel in 1977, where he earned a PhD in mathematical genetics for his dissertation on Games Theory and another PhD for his research about the mathematical and philosophical approaches to Infinity. He teaches mathematics, psychology, philosophy, and literature. Haim is an author of seven best-selling books. Shapira is not trying to make his readers agree with him, but simply encourages them to enjoy thinking. &nbsp;He is one of Israel's most popular and in-demand speakers and gives lectures on creativity and strategic thinking, existential philosophy and philosophy in children's literature, happiness and optimism, nonsense and insanity, imagination and the meaning of meaning, as well as friendship and love. He is also an accomplished pianist and an avid collector of anything beautiful.</p><h2>Chinese Humanism and Christian Spirituality</h2><p><p>In the essays collected here, John C. H. Wu (1899&#x2013;1986), the prominent 20th-century scholar of both Chinese and western law, philosophy, literature, and spirituality, illustrates with striking originality the harmonious synthesis of Chinese humanism (especially the wisdom of the ancient sages) with Christian spirituality as articulated in the Bible and the writings of the saints, mystics, and such modern spiritual writers as Therese of Lisieux. They display the depth and breadth of Wu&#x2019;s thought, which led him to the conclusion that the wisdom in all of China&#x2019;s traditions&#x2014;especially Confucian thought, Taoism, and Buddhism&#x2014;points to universal truths that originate from, and are fulfilled in, Christ, and that the &#x201c;marriage&#x201d; of the East and the West in Christ is the key to a future concordant understanding.</p> <p>&#x201c;The essay on St. Therese and Lao Tzu is profound and interesting, and the one on Celine, which is Confucian, admirably balances it.

Just as Wu himself was prepared for his encounter with Christ through the mediation of Therese of Lisieux, and by his profound knowledge of the great trinity of Chinese traditions, so western Christians may also find in those traditions confirmations rather than subversions or attenuations of their commitment to Christ.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>ROBERT M.

But you couldn&#x2019;t control everything, or it wouldn&#x2019;t be an experiment, right? Right.<br> &nbsp;<br> She rolled across the Everything Store parking lot and parked her bike by the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside, she said &#x201c;Hi&#x201d; to the clerk in an offhand, uninterested, ten-year-old kind of way and slipped off down the cosmetics aisle.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Rbblmmgh,&#x201d; mumbled the clerk, barely looking up.<br> &nbsp;<br> Amy&#x2019;s heart beat fast. She couldn&#x2019;t decide whether she was thrilled or frightened. Was there a difference?<br> &nbsp;<br> Focus! she told herself.<br> &nbsp;<br> She glanced at the big round mirror up in the corner of the ceiling. The clerk, theoretically, could see down every aisle, from everywhere in the store. Fortunately, Amy had planned for this.<br> &nbsp;<br> She would create a diversion.<br> &nbsp;<br> The diversion was something she had prepared ahead of time: a plastic sandwich bag full of orange pop and crushed cereal. Now, at the store, she removed it from her pocket, pulled off the twist tie, and dumped the contents onto the floor between the sunglasses and the school supplies.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then she poked her head around the endcap, waved at the clerk, and politely shouted, &#x201c;Sir? I think someone threw up in aisle three. It&#x2019;s really repulsive.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The clerk--who looked like a stick with a beard--sighed and mumbled, &#x201c;All right. Thanks, I guess.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Amy retreated into the painkiller/wound care aisle and waited until she heard the clerk get a mop and a bucket and head for the school supplies. Then she fast-walked halfway across the store to where the hoodies were kept stacked in a plastic tub.<br> &nbsp;<br> She checked the big round mirror. It was hard to tell what she was looking at, the way everything seemed to bend and recede down a black hole, but it kind of looked like the clerk was bent over, facing away. Good.<br> &nbsp;<br> Quickly Amy grabbed one of the hoodies and dove into it like you would a swimming pool (it was waaaaay too big), shooting her arms through the sleeves, popping her head out the top, and smoothing the whole thing until the bottom hem hung around her knees. Then she walked toward the door, between the shampoo and the greeting cards, just as casual as could be.<br> &nbsp;<br> Time seemed to slow down. Second by second, she was sure that NOW was the moment the clerk would call out, &#x201c;Wait a second there, kid!&#x201d; NOW was the moment his hand would come down on her lawbreaking, butterfly-winged shoulder; NOW was the moment her dark prison journey would begin. . . .&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The Crime Experiment was a mistake, she realized (too late).<br> &nbsp;<br> And sure enough, here came the footsteps behind her.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Library of Luminaries: Virginia Woolf: An Illustrated Biography</h2><p>One of literature's most beloved authors is beautifully documented in this illustrated biography of Virginia Woolf.

The desire to control the supply of this luxury item sparked wars between Britain and France, as well as conflicts between rival tribes and the newly formed United States of America, which continued until 1840. </p><p>The main tribes of the area were the Huron, Dakota, Sauk and Fox, Miami and Shawnee. All were drawn into the conflicts throughout the Great Lakes region during the French-Indian War (1754-1763), as well as the American Revolution.

This struggle drives many to depression and addictive tendencies. Author and New Thought minister Edward Viljoen argues that the struggle need not be an arduous or painful one&#x2014;that through everyday acts of kindness, faith, and compassion we can create peaceful and contented lives. Using personal stories, practical tips, and exercises, this book shows us that regardless of our circumstances, we can create meaning and beauty in our lives and in the world. Viljoen offers deep insights, showing:<br><br> - How caring about ordinary things leads to meaningful and extraordinary life experiences<br> - How society's messages about perfection distract us from our ordinary goodness<br> - How faith is a muscle that must be exercised <br> &nbsp;<br> People are always striving to live happy and fulfilled lives. This book reassures us that this is attainable&#x2014;nothing extraordinary is required.</p><p><b>Edward Viljoen</b> is the author of <i>The Power of Meditation</i>, and coauthor of <i>Seeing Good at Work </i>(with Joyce Duffala), and <i>Spirit is Calling</i>&nbsp;and <i>Practice the Presence </i>(with Chris Michaels). He is the senior minister at the Center for Spiritual Living in Santa Rosa, California.The Paradox of Being<br><br>How Life Is a Paradox of Wholeness and Brokenness<br><br>Author Anne Lamott, on the eve of her sixty-first birthday, wrote a list of things she knows about being. The first on the list is that All truth is a paradox. "Life, she wrote," is a precious unfathomably beautiful gift; and it is impossible here, on the incarnational side of things. It has been a very bad match for those of us who were born extremely sensitive. It is so hard and weird that we wonder if we are being punked. And it's filled with heartbreaking sweetness and beauty, floods and babies and acne and Mozart, all swirled together." Ordinary Goodness is an invitation to look courageously into the unfathomable mystery of being-not as something to be solved, but as something to embrace and enjoy. Without this patient approach, it is tough to make sense of the ambiguities and contradictions that life is peppered with. To hold life gently, without insisting that it conform to predictable patterns and clear-cut meaning, helps things flow a little more smoothly. A flexible view is essential when exploring goodness because it is inevitable that when studying goodness, we will encounter its opposite.<br><br>A friend told me the story of her visit to a Far Eastern spiritual teacher, a very sage and ancient man who spoke to her group for about forty minutes. When he had finished speaking, he opened the floor for questions, and one truth-seeker asked the sage for his thoughts about the state of the world, with all of its conflicts, crime, poverty, and war. The teacher sat in silence and considered the question, and then murmured shaking his head, "So sad, so sad." My friend said that it was as if she could see the world through his eyes for a brief moment.<br><br>I love the story of this sage and his utterance, "So sad, so sad." I do not feel the slightest bit discouraged by it. It helps me to know it is possible to see the world's conditions as they are, without losing sight of the natural goodness that is simultaneously present. The paradox of concurrently valid states that are opposite to each other fascinates me.<br><br>My friend's story reminded me of a poem by Ernest Holmes:<br><br>When death shall come<br><br>And the spirit, freed, shall mount the air,<br><br>And wander afar in that great no-where,<br><br>It shall go as it came,<br><br>Freed from sorrow, sin and shame;<br><br>And naked and bare, through the upper air<br><br>Shall go alone to that great no-where.<br><br>Hinder not its onward way,<br><br>Grieve not o'er its form of clay,<br><br>For the spirit, freed now from clod,<br><br>Shall go alone to meet its God.<br><br>I first encountered this poem at a time of grief and sadness. I liked it and felt comforted by the words, except that I struggled with the phrase "sorrow, sin and shame." I was in that phase of development where replacing every negative idea with something affirmative seemed necessary. I believed I had to reeducate my negatively habituated mind, and became inclined, for example, to replace the poetic words "wretch" with "soul" or "saint" in the hymn "Amazing Grace" because I could not tolerate the coexistence of wretchedness and goodness. Now I'm not so inclined to sugarcoat life. People like the sage, the poet, and the author of "Amazing Grace," John Newton, tell the story of humanity's journey through the valley of the shadows and are, I believe, at no time confused about the amazing grace available simultaneously while traveling through life's troubling territory.<br><br>Goodness is not necessarily sugarcoated. Ordinary goodness is both gritty and smooth, satisfying and frustrating, simple and confusing-and more.<br><br>It's Ordinary, and Natural<br><br>The idea of ordinary goodness came to me while teaching a class in which the students were learning the techniques of spiritual coaching. They questioned their ability to respond adequately to clients who were facing sorrow and tragedy. I asked them to settle down and think about a difficult time in their lives when someone did something for them that showed love. Some of them, teary-eyed, told stories about ordinary acts of kindness, while others told of gestures of compassion that went beyond the call of duty. The students either had a story of how loving-kindness from another person had touched them, or they identified with a story told by another student. I asked them if the giver of that love had any special skills. What was it that made the gift of love so meaningful? They answered that each giver had acted sincerely, from some natural instinct to care. I call that instinct ordinary goodness. I pointed out that they too had the same innate capacity to care, and that their goodness required no special training. It may be clumsy or unskilled, yet when expressed, especially through kindness, it leads to compassion. That is something mighty.<br><br>Practice<br><br>Notice Goodness and Share It<br><br>Donald Altman, in The Mindfulness Code, suggests that redirecting our attention to what we have in life does not cause us to ignore the real difficulties we, and those around us, may face. Rather, doing so helps us notice, appreciate, and enjoy the ordinary things that make life worthwhile. He provides this guidance:<br><br>First, turn your attention to what you have in your life from the very moment you wake in the morning. Appreciate the breath, the blankets that warm you, the shower that refreshes and cleans you, and even the alarm clock that wakes you up. Next, find a reminder of ordinary goodness that you can carry with you throughout the day, such as a picture of a loved one, a stone or other object from a memorable trip, or an inspirational quote. Finally, share your appreciation of ordinary goodness with others.<br><br>On the seven-day, 545-mile AIDS/Lifecycle bicycle ride to raise funds for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Foundation, there are many opportunities along the route to feel discouraged by exhaustion. One longtime rider has paid attention to the plight of discouraged cyclists and, in response, created the tradition of leaving plastic eggs-the kind that are typically filled with candy at Easter-on cyclists' seats during the night. In the egg is a short note of appreciation and a reminder of the heroic nature of riding to help fund another person's well-being.<br><br>When I participated in the ride in 2015, some mornings my attention was not on ordinary goodness. I had no warm blanket to practice Donald Altman's exercise on, and the showers were crowded and cramped. I was focused on needing more sleep; I needed a break. I needed to quit, and I needed coffee. Then, when I found the egg on my bike seat, it had the marvelous and surprising effect of making me feel as enthusiastic as I did on day one of the ride. One quiet moment of redirecting my attention, facilitated by the kindness of a stranger, had the impact of changing my energy level, it seemed. More than that, it touched my emotional center, and I started to share encouragement with other struggling riders.<br><br>Goodness as Awe<br><br>How Caring About the Ordinary Things Causes Extraordinary Life Experiences<br><br>My grandmother's relentless willingness to be kind inspired me. She expressed kindness as if it were the most natural thing in the world. She took care to be interested in-even awed by-whatever was directly in front of her. She would exclaim "My goodness" and "Goodness gracious me!" frequently when reviewing a report card, a new hat, or a new friend one of us brought home. We felt the warmth of her caring because she paid attention to us. In that way, she invested time in us, making us think for a moment that we were amazing. We received her generous and focused interest, even when she was clearly in pain or would prefer to be left alone. She almost always gave her attention when it was called upon.<br><br>Not everything we did was awe-worthy. Nevertheless, she treated us as if we were truly wonderful. Surely, there must have been times when she was pretending to be interested. I could not tell if ever she was. Watching the ease with which my grandmother paid attention to others inspired me to try doing the same. I practiced being interested in people in the same way that she showed interest in me. The more I tried, the easier it became. Not only that, but interest in others also turned out to be more enjoyable than I imagined it could be, and even felt genuine. I am a believer now in purposefully fostering the habit of being awe-filled and interested in life. It does not have to be the most colorful sunset to awe us. It does not have to be a gigantic sculpture or an exquisitely beautiful person or the biggest or most expensive something to stir us to awe. Awe and wonder are present in modest, ordinary things. When we accept awe and wonder to be an attitude of mind, with a little practice and creativity seeing the world with interest becomes a natural, and eventually permanent, addition to our worldview. It is precisely at times such as the ones we live in today that we must awaken the awareness of ordinary goodness by becoming attentive to and interested in it. We can start by becoming a little more interested in each other. You may doubt that it is possible to develop an interest in everyone, let alone have awe and wonder for them. You may question if it is natural to do so. But it can be done in the same way that we can learn other skills, such as writing. When I learned to write, I started, like everyone does, with the beginning exercise of mastering straight lines, which can be agonizing for some and easy for others. With patient encouragement from teachers and consistent practice, it came together, and I came to grips with the art of writing. Similarly, learning to type takes persistence. Remember the typing drills? We do not learn how to type by thinking about it. If we read a manual about typing, we might have some ideas about how to do it, but to get it into our fingers, we have to get into it. We have to invest time, and if we do so with a steady routine, we are rewarded with faster progress than if we approach it haphazardly. So it is with developing the awareness of ordinary goodness. We have to return steadfastly to the task and maintain slow, steady progress, which in itself is a challenge for a mind that is racing all the time.<br><br>Slow Down the Racing Mind<br><br>It is difficult for a fast-moving mind to connect with awe and wonder. It's hard to maintain interest in others and care about them when your mind is at the center of a storm of racing thoughts. Thoughts have to be slowed down for awe and caring to have a chance. When I pay attention to my thinking, I can see there is a difference in the speed of my thoughts when they are fearful, angry, selfish, or envious compared to when they are confident, loving, sharing, and kind. I perceive that when my mind is moving fast, it is prone to being unmindful. When I am paying attention to life or other people, the interest I show in them slows down my thinking to a gentle and mindful pace. Traveling at top speed in a vehicle makes the journey dangerous and raises the possibility of accidents. At high speeds, the landscape becomes a blur, and we cannot see details clearly, and that makes us prone to hurting others. It can be a challenge to enjoy a moment in nature, or with another person, when my thoughts are stacked one on top of the other and I am focused on something other than what or who is in front of me.<br><br>If I notice my mind speeding up, stimulated by fearful thoughts, I try to slow it down and bring it back to the present moment. I try to pay attention to whatever task is at hand as peacefully as I can. Sometimes I can spend a whole morning, or even a day, bringing my mind back to the present moment. When my thoughts move too quickly, I don't readily notice the experiences that have the potential to stop me in my tracks so that I say, "Oh, my goodness." We need those moments. They shine a light on our path, enlarge our perspective, and guide us through to the other side of our dark moments. These experiences of being stopped in our tracks from time to time expand our minds, and whether we say, "Goodness gracious me," or "Oh my God," or "Wow," these moments have the ability to unlock our untaught appreciation of what is good.<br><br>What is there to be awestruck by?<br><br>Consider the following questions and others like them as a way of slowing down the mind and practicing the feeling of awe and wonder: What did my neighborhood look like one hundred years ago? What will my community look like one hundred years from now? Or research the answers to questions such as: How far is it to the nearest star? How deep is the deepest ocean? Who were the indigenous people of the area I live in? What are the natural flowers in this area? What phase of the moon are we in? What was your great-, great-, great-grandmother's maiden name? What did her daily schedule look like? How do you know how to breathe, circulate blood, and digest food all at the same time? How do fingernails know how to grow, and how come you have the recipe to produce them while dealing with your problems at the same time? And, my goodness-do you realize that we are floating through space as living, breathing marvels, off somewhere on a tiny, precious blue ball and no one knows where it is or where it is going?<br><br>In Thornton Wilder's Our Town, Emily, a young girl who has died and looks back at her life, asks, "Does anybody realize how wonderful life really is while they live it?" I don't know if my grandmother had any regrets, but if she did, she kept them to herself-but not like hot coals burning dangerously in her pocket, filling her with pain and bitterness. She seemed present for the world around her. She seemed engaged and endlessly available to be amazed and interested in life. When she passed away, we sorted through her possessions. I was surprised to find, in her box of clearly most-treasured items, a rosary with a love letter from an officer of the United Kingdom's Royal Navy, along with his travel documents and a photograph dated from when she must have been sixteen years old, a few months before she was to be married.</p><h2>Write Your Memoir: The Soul Work of Telling Your Story</h2><p>Drawing from more than 25 years of literary know-how and modeled after a 15-week college course, this manual provides guidance for seekers wishing to delve further into self-exploration through writing. Extending beyond the idea that memoir writing intends to put past events into a more understandable current perspective, the guide maintains that keeping a document of one&#x2019;s life is actually the basis of a psychic process called &#x201c;soul work,&#x201d; which manifests as a desire to experience the state of being alive to the fullest. This unusual approach to memoir writing aims to generate more honest and genuine results that come from inner needs rather than outer expectations. Intended to clarify a writer&#x2019;s developmental path, this resource emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the need for dealing with difficult material that actually alters the writer in the process, resulting in significant growth of the soul.</p><p>Allan G.

Carole Boston Weatherford&#x2019;s poetic text is perfectly matched with Eric Velasquez&#x2019;s powerful oil paintings.</p><p>Author Carole Boston Weatherford lives in High Point, North Carolina.<br><br>Illustrator Eric Velasquez lives in Hartsdale, New York.Grade 3-6-This book traces the evolution of jazz in a poem of four-line stanzas that begins with an African drum beat and ends with a rapper who still hears "-the age-old, far-off beat/of Africa drumming on every street." Each stanza accompanies a full-spread oil painting outlined with a crayon line and bordered in white. On many pages, one figure-an African kalimba player, a Delta bluesman, etc.-is featured in front of the painting, breaking the frame and extending into the white space below. The animated African animals and dancers depicted in warm golds and browns contrast sharply with the still figures and somber tones of the scenes on slave ships and in plantation fields. These, too, contrast with the bright colors and movement of the cakewalkers, gospel singers, and swing and bebop musicians with their arms or instruments lifted joyously upward. The final illustration of a young African-American trumpet player with his family against a background that incorporates many elements from the previous paintings is a satisfying synthesis of both the visual and written elements of the book: "JAZZ is a downbeat born in our nation,/chords of struggle and jubilation,/bursting forth from hearts set free/in notes that echo history./This is the sound that jazz makes!" Although some of the rhymes don't scan as well as others, this is still an especially attractive, satisfying pictorial introduction to and celebration of this unique American musical form.<br><i>Ginny Gustin, Sonoma County Library System, Santa Rosa, CA </i><br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Ancient Mesopotamia Inside Out (Ancient Worlds Inside Out)</h2><p>&#34;This important book explores the culture and achievements of ancient Mesopotamia through the examination of artifacts that have survived through the centuries.

Along with a wide variety of makes and models of trowels, extensive time-tested techniques are used to create beautifully appealing atmospheres out of earth. These can be incorporated into todays world-wide green and natural building movement to create a better balance between ourselves and our living environment.</p><p>I studied and apprenticed Japan&#39;s natural earthen wall building craft in Kyoto for one year before returning to the United States to re-join the natural building movement in 2008. Despite having grown up in Japan, I never &#34;saw&#34; their clay walls until I returned in 2003 after having started on a path of natural building in the US. Old, slightly crumbling walls of country side homes which revealed sturdy earthen structures clued me into the the existence of a highly evolved earthen building craft. I knew I couldn&#39;t return to the US until I learned it. A year of searching went by before I found a place that would train me using only traditional materials, through which I found my master. My apprenticeship experience helped me to understand why more people outside of Japan don&#39;t know about the depth of the Japanese knowledge of using earth to build. It also continuously exposed me to techniques and knowledge I strongly feel would benefit the worldwide green and natural building movement. Their skills and knowledge have been tested by time -- hurricanes, earthquakes and all. Yet their earthen walls still stand intact, and restoration can be done with recycled and natural materials. That is just what the environmentally conscious building world is all about. Sturdy. Beautiful. Healthy. Good. May there be a fruitful exchange of information developing between all earthen home builders, new and restored, to further happiness and balance.</p><h2>Meeting St. John Today: Understanding the Man, His Mission, and His Message</h2><p><p>John&#x2019;s Gospel is a literary and theological masterpiece&#x2014;but therein lays the problem for many people in the pew.

They once did so by promising protections from the forces of capital and the market&#x2019;s tendencies to produce inequality. But in the 1990s they gave up on protection, asking voters to adapt to a market-driven world. Meanwhile, new, extreme parties began to promise economic protections of their own&#x2015;albeit in an angry, anti-immigrant tone.</p><p>To better understand today&#x2019;s strange new political world, Stephanie L. Mudge&#x2019;s <i>Leftism Reinvented </i>analyzes the history of the Swedish and German Social Democrats, the British Labour Party, and the American Democratic Party. Breaking with an assumption that parties simply respond to forces beyond their control, Mudge argues that left parties&#x2019; changing promises expressed the worldviews of different kinds of experts. To understand how left parties speak, we have to understand the people who speak for them.</p><p><i>Leftism Reinvented </i>shows how Keynesian economists came to speak for left parties by the early 1960s. These economists saw their task in terms of discretionary, politically-sensitive economic management. But in the 1980s a new kind of economist, who viewed the advancement of markets as left parties&#x2019; main task, came to the fore. Meanwhile, as voters&#x2019; loyalties to left parties waned, professional strategists were called upon to &#x201c;spin&#x201d; party messages. Ultimately, left parties undermined themselves, leaving a representative vacuum in their wake. <i>Leftism Reinvented</i> raises new questions about the roles and responsibilities of left parties&#x2015;and their experts&#x2015;in politics today.</p></p><p>Stephanie L. Mudge is Associate Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of California, Davis.&#x201c;How were the parties of the center-left converted from Keynesian technocracy to third-way neoliberalism? Stephanie Mudge presents a highly original account featuring changes in the economics profession leading to the displacement of economic experts in government policy and party politics by political consultants and spin doctors. Covering the United States and four European countries, the book adds importantly to our understanding of recent political history, the transformation of left-wing political parties, and today&#x2019;s crisis of democratic politics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Wolfgang Streeck, Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies</b><br><br>&#x201c;Why is the Left failing everywhere? Because back in the 1990s, left-wing parties gave up on growing their core constituencies, turning instead to a cadre of technicians. Mudge argues that success of center-left parties rested upon their ability to &#x2018;win, represent, and <i>shape how people think</i>.&#x2019; This latter goal used to be the province of &#x2018;economist theoreticians&#x2019; who embraced a &#x2018;Keynesian ethic.&#x2019; But as economics changed, so did the visions of the economists who guided left parties. Why the Left is dying owes much to their interventions.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mark Blyth, Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs, Brown University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Stephanie L. Mudge has written a magisterial account explaining how neoliberalism came to be a dominant way of thinking among the European and American Left. Through a detailed and rich sociological account, she explains that leftist parties changed their way of seeing and wanting to shape the social world because of their shifting relationship to economic knowledge. Economic experts, far from the original organic intellectuals of labor movements, became the mediators of ideological transformation, shaping party positions and confirming neoliberalism as the current version of progressive politics. This is a necessary book for everyone with an interest in progressive politics.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jenny Andersson, Co-Director, Max Planck Sciences Po Center on Coping with Instability in Market Societies (MaxPo)</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Leftism Reinvented</i> provides a wealth of information, and very few scholars exhibit Mudge&#x2019;s mastery of the economic policies across so many parties over such a stretch of time...It is necessary reading for anyone seeking to understand our current political predicament.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edwin Amenta</b><b>, </b><b><i>American Journal of Sociology</i></b></p><h2>Acts (Paideia: Commentaries on the New Testament)</h2><p>In<i> Acts</i>, the third of eighteen volumes in the Paideia commentary series, leading biblical scholar Mikeal Parsons gleans fresh theological insight into Acts by attending carefully to the cultural and educational context from which it emerges.

This vivid, dramatically told account depicts how fate shifted based on Hitler's mistaken belief that he'd actually lost the air war over Britain - and portrays the unsurpassed, "we-can-take-it" bravery of the British people when they'd been pushed beyond all human endurance.</p><p>Gavin Mortimer is a native Londoner. He began writing by freelancing for several publications, including the <b>London Evening Standard</b>, the <b>Observer</b>, and the <b>Guardian</b>. He has contributed articles to a richly diverse range of magazines from <b>Esquire</b> to <b>BBC History</b> to <b>Rugby World</b>. This is his fourth book, the first to be published in the U.S.Drawing on scores of eyewitness accounts and previously classified records, British journalist Mortimer has written the first extensive account of the deadliest night of the 1940&#x2013;1941 London Blitz. Believing that "terror attacks" against civilians would break "England's will to resist," the Luftwaffe began bombing London on September 7, 1940. Instead of caving in, however, the British responded with an endearing bravado. The great raid of May 10&#x2014;"the savage climax to the Blitz"&#x2014;severely strained that indomitable spirit. That night, the Germans sent 507 aircraft to drop 711 tons of bombs&#x2014;including 86,173 incendiary bombs&#x2014;on London. By dawn on May 11, London was near collapse. More than 2,000 fires blackened the sky, 11,000 homes lay in ruins and more than 3,000 people were dead or wounded. What Londoners did not know was that that night would be the last major raid against the city; the Blitz would end on May 16. While Mortimer focuses on London, he also switches the narrative seamlessly among the city's residents, the air crews at their bases in the English countryside and the Luftwaffe pilots attacking from their bases in occupied France. The author notes that the Blitz has become a clich� to later generations and asks rhetorically if it has "relevance in modern London." The recent terrorist bombings in London's subways emphatically answer that question. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

M. FORSTER<br><br>THE MIMETIC APE. Reading Alfonso Reyes revealed to me, at the appropriate time, an exercise recommended by one of his literary idols, Robert Louis Stevenson, in his Letter to a Young Gentlemen Who Proposes to Embrace the Career of Art, consisting of an imitation exercise. He himself had practiced it, and with success, during his period of apprenticeship. The Scottish author compared his method to the imitative aptitude of monkeys. The future writer should transform himself into an ape with a high capacity for imitation, should read his preferred authors with an attention closer to tenacity than delight, more in tune with the activity of the detective than the pleasure of the aesthete; he should learn by which means to achieve certain results, to detect the efficacy of some formal processes, study the handling of narrative time, of tone, the organization of details in order to apply those devices later to his own writing; a novel, let us say, with a plot similar to that of the chosen author, with comparable characters and situations, where the only liberty allowed would be the employment of his own language: his, that of his family and friends, perhaps his region&#x2019;s; the great school of training and imitation,&#x201d; added Reyes, of which the truly original Lope de Vega speaks in La Dorotea:<br>How do you compose? I read,<br>and what I read, I imitate,<br> and what I imitate, I write,<br> and what I write, blot out,<br> and then I sift the blottings-out.&#x201d;<br>An indispensable education, provided the budding writer knows to jump from the train at the right moment, untie whatever tethers him to the chosen style as a starting point, and knows intuitively the right moment at which to embrace everything that writing requires. By then he must know that language is the decisive factor, and that his destiny will depend on his command of it. When all is said and done, it will be style that emanation of language and of instinct that will create and control the plot.<br>When in the mid-fifties I began to sketch my first stories, two languages ??exercised control over my fledgling literary vision: that of Borges and that of Faulkner. Their splendor was such that for a time they overshadowed all others. That subjugation allowed me to ignore the telluric risks of the time, the monotone costumbrismo and the false modernity of the narrative prose of the Contempor�neos, to whose poetry, at the same time, I was addicted. In this splendid group of poets, some Xavier Villaurrutia, Jorge Cuesta, Salvador Novo also excelled for their essays. They had availed themselves during their early years of the lessons of Alfonso Reyes and of Julio Torri. Nevertheless, when they made incursions into the short story, they inevitably failed. They believed they were repeating the brilliant effects of Gide, Giraudoux, Cocteau, and Bontempelli, whom they venerated, as a means of escaping the rancho, the tenebrous jungle, the mighty rivers, and they succeeded, but at the expense of careening into tedium and, at times, into the ridiculous. The effort was obvious, the seams were too visible, the stylization became a parody of the European authors in whose shadow they sought refuge. If someone ordered me today, pistol in hand, to reread the Proserpina rescatada [Rescued Prosperpina] by Jaime Torres Bodet, I would probably prefer to be felled by bullets than plunge into that sea of ??folly.<br>I must have been seventeen when I first read Borges. I remember the experience as if it happened just a few days ago. I was traveling to Mexico City after spending a holiday in C�rdoba with my family. The bus made a stop in Tehuac�n for lunch. It was Sunday so I bought a newspaper: the only thing about the press that interested me at the time was the cultural supplement and theater and movie guide. The supplement was the legendary M�xico en la Cultura, arguably the best there has ever been in Mexico, under the direction of Fernando Ben�tez. The main text in that edition was an essay on the Argentine fantastic short story, signed by the Peruvian writer Jos� Durand. Two stories appeared as examples of Durand&#x2019;s theses: The Horses of Abdera&#x201d; by Leopoldo Lugones and The House of Asterion&#x201d; by Jorge Luis Borges, a writer completely foreign to me. I began with the fantastic tale by Lugones, an elegant example of postmodernismo, and proceeded to The House of Asterion.&#x201d; It was, perhaps, the most dazzling revelation in my life as a reader. I read the story with amazement, with gratitude, with absolute astonishment. When I reached the final sentence, I gasped. Those simple words: Would you believe it, Ariadne?&#x2019; Theseus said. The Minotaur scarcely defended himself,&#x201d; spoken as if in passing, almost at random, suddenly revealed the mystery that the story concealed: the identity of the enigmatic protagonist, his resigned sacrifice. Never had I imagined that our language could reach such levels of intenseness, levity, and surprise. The next day, I went out in search of other books by Borges; I found several, covered in dust on the backmost shelves of a bookshop. During those years, readers of Borges in Mexico could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Years later I read the stories written by him and by Adolfo Bioy Casares, signed with the pseudonym H. Bustos Domecq. Delving into those stories written in lunfardo posed a grueling challenge. One had to sharpen his linguistic intuition and allow himself to be carried away by the sensual cadence of the words, the same as that of fiery tangos, so not to lose the thread of the story too quickly. They were police mysteries unraveled from an Argentine prison cell by the amateur of crime, Honorio Bustos Domecq, a not-so bright man with a healthy dose of common sense, which linked him to Chesterton&#x2019;s Father Brown. The plot was of least importance; what was superb about them was their language, a playful, polysemic language, a delight to the ear, like that of the serious Borges, but nonsensical. Bustos Domecq allows himself to establish a euphonious proximity between words, to surrender to a bizarre, rambling, and torrential course, that gradually sketches the outlines of the story, until arriving in an invertebrate, secretive, parodic, and kitschy fashion to the long-awaited climax. On the other hand, the verbal order of the books by the serious Borges is precise and obedient to the will of the author; his adjectivization suggests an inner sadness, but it is rescued by an amazing verbal imagination and contained irony. I have read and reread the stories, poetry, literary and philosophical essays of this brilliant man, but I never conceived of him as an enduring influence on my work, as was Faulkner, although in a recent rereading of my Divina garza [Divine Heron], I was able to perceive echoes and murmurs close to those of Bustos Domecq.<br>To establish a symmetry, it&#x2019;s necessary to mention the language of Faulkner and its influence I willingly accepted during my period of initiation. His Biblical sonorousness, his grandeur of tone, his tremendously complex construction, where a sentence may span several pages, branching out voraciously, leaving readers breathless, are unequalled. The darkness that emerges from the dense arborescence, whose meaning will be revealed many pages or chapters later, is not a mere narrative process, but rather, as in Borges, the very flesh of the story. A darkness born of the immoderate crossing of phrases of a different order is a way of enhancing a secret that as a rule the characters meticulously conceal.<br>THE MAGICIAN OF VIENNA. Of all man&#x2019;s instruments, the most wondrous, no doubt, is the book,&#x201d; says Borges. The other instruments are extensions of his body. The microscope, the telescope, are extensions of his sight; the telephone is an extension of his voice; then we have the plow and the sword, extensions of his arm. But the book is something else altogether: the book is an extension of his memory and imagination.&#x201d;<br>The book accomplishes a multitude of tasks, some superb, others deplorable; it dispenses knowledge and misery, illuminates and deceives, liberates and manipulates, exalts and humbles, creates or cancels the options of life. Without it, needless to say, no culture would be possible. History would disappear, and our future would be cloaked in dark, sinister clouds. Those who hate books also hate life. No matter how impressive the writings of hatred may be, the printed word for the most part tips the balance toward light and generosity. Don Quixote will always triumph over Mein Kampf. As for the humanities and the sciences, books will continue to be their ideal space, their pillars of support.<br>There are those who read to kill time. Their attitude toward the printed page is passive: they repine, revel, sob, writhe in laughter; the final pages where all mysteries are revealed will ultimately allow them to sleep more soundly. They seek those spaces in which the elementary reader always takes great delight. To satisfy them, the plots must produce the greatest excitement at a minimum cost of complexity. The characters are univocal: ideal or abysmal, there is no third way; the former will be virtuous, magnanimous, industrious, observant of every social norm; they are excessively kind-hearted even if their superficial philanthropy sometimes tarnishes the whole with cloyingly saccharine registers; by contrast, the wickedness, cowardice, and pettiness of the indispensable villains know no bounds, and even if they attempt to turn over a new leaf, an evil instinct will prevail over their will that is sure to haunt them forever; they&#x2019;ll end up destroying those around them before turning on themselves in their desire for unremitting destruction. In short, readers who are addicted to the struggle between good versus evil turn to the book to amuse themselves and to kill time, never to dialogue with the world, with others, or with themselves.<br>In popular novels, beginning with the nineteenth-century feuilletons of Ponson du Terrail, Eug�ne Sue, and Paul Feval, female orphans appear in abundance, defenseless all; to the tragedy of orphanage the narrator sadistically adds other troubles: blindness, muteness, shrewishness, paralysis, and amnesia, above all amnesia. When these female orphans lose their memory and are rich to boot, they become easy prey for fortune hunters. Clearly the wide array of male fauna who wander through these stories have Ph.Ds. in evil. One of their specialties is pretending to be deserted husbands or lovers. When they happen upon one of these fragilely forgetful young women, and discover their circumstances, they go about laying claim to nonexistent children whom the aforementioned amnesiacs took out for a stroll years ago, never to return; they almost always convince them of, and threaten to denounce them for, having brutally murdered the children whom they detested; they inform them that during the weeks prior to their disappearance they did nothing but talk about the visceral hatred they displayed for the accursed offspring born of their womb and that they implored God with the ferociousness of hyenas that He rid them of these detestable children. Thus, seizing on the horror they feel for themselves and the panic they instill in them, these lotharios enslave the damsels carnally, seize control of their assets, force them to sign before a notary a thick stack of papers that consign to them their real estate, their jewelry deposited in safe deposit boxes, their bank accounts, investment documents scattered in national and international banks to these insatiable wolves, which were precisely that, counterfeit husbands and lovers who had so suddenly and suspiciously surfaced.<br>Some, the most credulous, were convinced that in their previous incarnation a term they used to allude to their existence prior to their amnesia they had been nuns, and in that capacity had committed unspeakable blasphemies and countless depravities, such as strangling the portress of the convent, the gardener, or even the Mother Superior, only to wander the world lost, for years thereafter, until being found, identified, and reunited with the vast fortune that their deceased parents had deposited into some banking institution.<br></p><h2>Too Many Fairies: A Celtic Tale</h2><p><p>There was once an old woman who hated chores.

She is a folklorist, children's librarian, and the author of more than 55 books on folklore and storytelling.&nbsp; Dr. MacDonald lives in Kirkland, Washington.<br><br>Illustrator Susan Mitchell lives in Montreal, Canada.Kindergarten-Grade 3&#x2014;An old woman grumbles, "Work! Work! Work! How I hate it! Hate it! Hate it!" Her complaining soon brings four fairies to her door to perform her chores&#x2014;washing dishes, sweeping, making the bed, and knitting. But all of the help still can't stop her from complaining about all the noise the fairies are making: "clankety, clankety," "swishety, swishety," "lumpety, flumpety," and "clickety clickety." "These fairies are driving me crazy!" she laments. But when she tells them to stop, they begin to reverse all of their chores, tearing everything apart. A visit to the village wise one teaches the complaining old woman a lesson about being content with her own situation. This Scottish folktale is subtle but effective in its message of humility. The illustrations are folksy and warm with amusing detail. Notable are the old woman's pointed shoes, the fairies' woodland-creature apparel, and the animation of ordinary household items. A fun read-aloud.&#x2014;<i>C. J. Connor, Campbell County Public Library, Cold Spring, KY</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010. Library Journals LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Media Source, Inc.

Drawing on his extensive background in option-pricing and on decades of experience in investment management and trading, Brian Johnson developed these tools specifically to manage option income strategies. Unlike crude rules-of-thumb, these revolutionary new tools can be applied to any option income strategy, on any underlying security, in any market environment. Risk and return are timeless concepts in finance and trading, but this is the first time both concepts have been integrated successfully into a consistent approach for managing option income strategies. Option Strategy Risk/Return Ratios is written in a clear, easy-to-understand fashion and explains how to apply risk/return ratios to condors, butterflies, calendars, double diagonals, and even hybrid income strategies. Created especially for investors who have some familiarity with options, this practical guide begins with an examination of option income strategies and is followed by a review of the option Greeks, the building blocks of option risk management. Next, a critique of common adjustment triggers lays the foundation for a detailed explanation of these exciting new tools: option strategy risk/return ratios. Each option income strategy is explained, evaluated, and ranked using these new tools with complete descriptions and graphical examples. The book includes over sixty separate graphs and tables to illustrate how risk/return ratios behave using specific strategy examples in actual market conditions. The risk/return ratios are then used to introduce a new hybrid strategy that combines the best characteristics of the other income strategies. Finally, the last chapter examines practical considerations and prospective applications of these innovative new tools. Not only are the formulas provided for every calculation, but each risk/return ratio is explained intuitively and depicted graphically. For traders who are not mathematically inclined, Option Strategy Risk/Return Ratios also includes a link to an Excel spreadsheet with macros designed to calculate all of the risk/return ratios introduced in the book. About the Author: Brian Johnson designed, programmed, and implemented the first return sensitivity based parametric framework actively used to control risk in fixed income portfolios. He further extended the capabilities of this approach by designing and programming an integrated series of option valuation, prepayment, and optimization models. Based on this technology, Mr. Johnson founded Lincoln Capital Management&#x2019;s fixed income index business, where he ultimately managed over $13 billion in assets for some of the largest and most sophisticated institutional clients in the U.S. and around the globe. He later served as the President of a financial consulting and software development firm, designing artificial intelligence-based forecasting and risk management systems for institutional investment managers. Mr. Johnson is now a full-time proprietary trader in options, futures, stocks, and ETFs primarily using algorithmic trading strategies. In addition to his professional investment experience, he also designed and taught courses in financial derivatives for both MBA and undergraduate business programs. He has written articles for the Financial Analysts Journal, Active Trader, and Seeking Alpha and he regularly shares his trading insights and research ideas as the editor of www.TraderEdge.Net. Mr. Johnson holds a B.S. degree in finance with high honors from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an MBA degree with a specialization in Finance from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</p><p>Brian Johnson designed, programmed, and implemented the first returnsensitivity based parametric framework actively used to control risk infixed income portfolios.

Rather than relying on size or speed, it was their sheer numbers that made them so effective. Indeed, the Casablanca-class escort carrier was the most-produced aircraft carrier in history. In partnership with the Royal Navy, they provided the backbone of Allied antisubmarine efforts in the Atlantic, finally and irrevocably turning the tide of the war against the U-boats in 1943. In the Pacific, they provided the air cover for the series of landings which led to the doorstep of Japan by 1945. These robust ships faced submarine, air, and even surface threats from the Japanese, but proved able to contend with everything thrown their way.</p><p>Fully illustrated with contemporary photographs and unique specially commissioned artwork, this book shines a new light on these unjustly overlooked workhorses of the US Navy--ships that helped usher in the Allied victory over the Axis powers in the Atlantic and Pacific.</p></p><p>Mark E.

If an earthquake struck today, or any other natural disaster, the power, water and sewage can be knocked out for extended periods, possibly months. So where do you go to the toilet? Although everyone talks about being prepared for an emergency event, very few actually know what to do when disaster strikes. And in these days of multiple uncertainties, ranging from economic fallout, increasing climatic extremes and earth changes, it pays to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.Regardless of whether your goal is for green living self sufficiency or emergency preparedness, the most basic necessities need to be addressed. These include water treatment, hygiene, ablutions, shelter, food treatment and storage, power generation, hot water, heating, fuel and transport. The Self Sufficiency Survival guide and manual will give you ideas for all of these.The most basic needs, like where to go to the toilet, is a common problem that happens in every such case, whether it be a Third World country or modern city. People in Haiti and also Christchurch New Zealand were still experiencing the effects over two years after their earthquakes.Converting a high-top van with simple low-cost techniques can make economic sense because you can use it for convenient weekend holidays away from home and it&#x2019;s handy if you need it in an emergency. However, if that&#x2019;s not possible, there are other things you can do.Ideally you&#x2019;ll prepare for an emergency event before it strikes - as the Chinese saying goes, better to fix the roof while the sun is shining.With a little imagination and determination it&#x2019;s possible to be self sufficient in our modern age, even when living in the city suburbs. In Indonesia they have public toilets that are completely self contained. The water system, the recycling of the wastewater, the filtration system is all done naturally. There are also hotels that employ that natural system, flushing out the industrial wastes and detergents using an eco-friendly natural system.The wastewater, including sewage is flushed into a chamber with a blade that breaks up the solids into slurry. After it&#x2019;s passed through a series of chambers in the filtering process, the liquid passes through a gravel reed bed, while the solids in the chambers break down through natural enzymes. The reeds and water plants in the gravel bed thrive on the constant supply of nutrient rich fluids and the water that comes out the other end is purified by the process. The water is then used to feed the gardens.The same thing is achievable for individual homes and small communities. The cost savings from getting away from reliance on public systems offsets the initial set-up costs. Of course, the journey to self sufficiency, like any journey, begins with the first basic steps. In the first section of the manual we&#x2019;ll cover the main items you&#x2019;ll need, starting with the easy to obtain and building up to &#x201c;great to have&#x201d;. Depending on your living situation, you may not have the storage facilities for some of the larger items, but everyone can start with the basics, even if only on a small scale. These self sufficient living books include tips ranging from how to survive a natural disaster to family self sufficiency program. The self sufficient homestead gives the option of how to live off the grid with no money. These books about living off the grid homes also include guides of how to prepare for disaster survival</p><p></p><h2>Mary in the New Testament</h2><p>Collaborative statement by Protestant, Anglican and Roman Catholic scholars on how Mary was pictured by Christians of the first two centuries.</p><p></p><h2>Minding the Store: A Big Story about a Small Business</h2><p><b>&#x201c;I really enjoyed this book.

The great theme of Ephesians is the one church, the new spiritual temple God is erecting of Jew and Gentile. Because of its profundity and scope, it is one of the most demanding of books upon which adequately to comment.<br><br>Charles Hodge, whose commentaries on 1 and 2 Corinthians were among the earlier volumes in the Geneva Series, is qualified on several grounds to write on Ephesians. Though a competent linguist, his main interest was not in the field of textual criticism. Hodge, first and foremost, was a theologian, and without a mastery of systematic theology one cannot do justice to the early chapters of Ephesians. Reference may also be made to his noted piety and graciousness, his catholic spirit and his wide vision.<br><br>The great virtue of Hodge on Ephesians is his ability constantly to communicate the sense and overall argument of a passage. A peerless teacher, his aim, with the pen as in the classroom, was the simple exhibition of the truth which God had revealed - his own description of Paul's preaching.</p><p>Scholar, educator, churchman, and distinguished American Presbyterian systematic theologian of the nineteenth century, Charles Hodge was born in Philadelphia in 1797. Following his father's untimely death a few years after he was born, Charles and his brother were raised by their godly widowed mother. In 1812 Hodge's mother moved the family to Princeton in hope of matriculating her sons at Princeton College.<br><br>Charles Hodge graduated from Princeton College in 1815. During the 1814-15 school year a revival broke out on the college campus: Charles was one of a number of students converted during this time of spiritual refreshing. At the encouragement of Archibald Alexander, he enrolled at Princeton Theological Seminary, graduating with the class of 1819.<br><br>Ordained in 1821, his scholarly gifts led to an appointment by his denomination in 1822 to serve as the seminary's third faculty member. As Professor of Oriental and Biblical Literature, Hodge's primary responsibility was instruction in biblical languages, hermeneutics, biblical criticism, and study of Old Testament texts. During 1826-28, he travelled to Europe to study with the leading European biblical and theological scholars. Hodge focused his studies on theology and biblical interpretation, with additional concentration in Semitic and cognate languages. His studies in Europe made him one of the leading Hebraists teaching in an American theological institution in the early nineteenth century. In the coming decade, Hodge would be assisted by the linguistic talent and philological expertise of Joseph Addison Alexander.<br><br>With Addison's arrival, Hodge concentrated his labours on New Testament texts and studies, serving as Professor of Exegetical and Didactic Theology from 1840 to 1854. From 1854 until his death in 1878, he served as Professor of Exegetical, Didactic, and Polemic Theology.<br><br>During his half-century tenure at Princeton, Charles Hodge held several chairs, but is probably best remembered for the reputation he established as Professor of Systematic Theology. A stout Calvinist with a deep love for the Reformed confessions, his literary labours often involved a polemical thrust, as he sought to defend and expound the Reformed theology of the Protestant Reformation, and the teachings of the Westminster Confession and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, as received and adopted by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.</p><h2>CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO MENTAL ILLNESS: MUTUAL CARE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The Christian response to mental illness is one of the great tragedies to ravage the church today. This tragedy began with the rise of the medical model of mental illness. The medical model used in the world of medicine has been hopelessly hijacked by those in the field of mental illness. The implications threaten the very foundations of psychiatry, as they depend on the medical model for diagnosing and treating mental disorders. These implications also threaten the foundations of psychotherapy and the biblical counseling movement as they follow the psychological counseling format. The very terms mental illness, mental disorder, and mental disease have become a blight to society, as they have been misunderstood, misapplied, misconstrued, and misused by many in both society and the church.The purpose in writing this book is to encourage believers to minister to all who seek biblical, spiritual care, including individuals who are suffering from mental illness or who are suffering from other mental-emotional-behavioral issues, known in Scripture as trials and tribulations.</p><p></p><h2>The Last of the Fathers: Saint Bernard of Clairvaux and the Encyclical Letter &#39;Doctor Mellifluus&#39;</h2><p>Merton presents one of the most significant encyclical letters of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, together with an introduction to the life and teachings of the great mystic.

The truth was, in fact, that it was like no other job in the world, except that there were good days and bad days. But the bad days were really, truly, epically bad. The bad days were spent standing too close to a decomposing body, trying not to gag. The bad days were random acts of violence on empty streets late at night with no witnesses. The bad days were domestic punch-ups that had got out of hand, dead drug addicts in dingy bedsits, elderly shut-ins whose neighbors only cared enough to call the police when the smell was too revolting to bear. I didn&#x2019;t care to count up how many days were bad ones; I suspected I wouldn&#x2019;t like the answer. But I could deal with it. I could cope.<br><br>I wasn&#x2019;t sure, however, that I could cope with my new case. More specifically, I wasn&#x2019;t sure that I could cope with my new boss. I wasn&#x2019;t at all sure I could stand it if all the days were bad, if every minute was another minute closer to breaking my spirit. I stared out of the car window as I half-listened to the driver beside me and wished I were somewhere else, with someone else.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t like me to be so unenthusiastic but nothing about my current situation was good. I was on my way to a crime scene I didn&#x2019;t want to face, accompanied by Detective Inspector Josh Derwent, one of two new additions to the team at that level. He and the other new DI, Keith Bryce, had worked with Godley before. That was about all they seemed to have in common. Bryce was quietly melancholy, and his face was as rumpled as his suits. Derwent was younger and had a reputation for being obsessively hard-working and infinitely aggressive. As far as I could tell, he liked fast driving, soft rock, and the sound of his own voice. Rumor had it he didn&#x2019;t like junior detectives to answer back. Handle with care was the advice circulating in the office, and I watched him covertly as he drove, heavy on the accelerator, heavy on the brake, swearing and spinning the wheel one-handed as if he were in a games arcade rather than pushing to make time on traffic-clogged London streets. Magic FM blared from the car radio, middle-of-the-road music at its most blandly inoffensive. Derwent sang along occasionally, unself-conscious even though he didn&#x2019;t know me at all. Not that I was likely to make anyone feel on edge, least of all him. I was the most junior of detective constables and he was an inspector, fifteen years in the job.<br><br>I had been prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt. I had suffered enough from misplaced gossip, from the assumptions made about me based on my looks, my height, my youth, my name. So when Superintendent Godley summoned me to his office and I found Derwent there already, leaning up against the glass wall that separated the boss from the rest of us, I didn&#x2019;t expect trouble. I should have known better. Even someone as inexperienced as me knew that when the superintendent didn&#x2019;t meet your eyes, it was time to get nervous.<br><br>&#x201c;Maeve, you haven&#x2019;t met Josh Derwent yet, have you? He&#x2019;s taking the lead on a new job we&#x2019;ve picked up in Brixton&#x2014;a double murder, of sorts.&#x201d;<br><br>Derwent acknowledged me with a fleeting look, no smile. He was of average height but thick through the neck and shoulders, muscled like a bulldog. He was too rugged to be called handsome but his close-cropped hair, strong jaw and broken nose, and the tan he&#x2019;d earned while training for marathons, made him distinctive. You&#x2019;d certainly think twice before getting into a fight with him. The marathon running was a hobby that had raised eyebrows among my colleagues, most of whom counted a short jog to the vending machine as exercise. According to them, long-distance running was public masochism and a further sign that Derwent wasn&#x2019;t to be trusted. For my part, I couldn&#x2019;t work out how he found the time to train, but otherwise I didn&#x2019;t care. And he was certainly in great shape. It was really only the fact that he was standing in the same room with Superintendent Godley that made him look ordinary, but then there were comparatively few men who could measure up to the boss. Tall, with hair that had turned silver-white when he was still a young man, Godley was startlingly attractive. He must have been aware of the effect he had on people, but he seemed to be utterly without vanity. No one would dare to underestimate him because of his appearance; it was impossible to mistake what lay behind his brilliant blue eyes for anything but a sharp, focused intelligence.<br><br>But today, for some reason, the focus was off. Godley looked strained and sounded distracted, fumbling among his papers for the notes on the new case and not finding what he was looking for.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have the details to hand, but we&#x2019;ve got two men, both tortured to death, bodies found within a mile of each other in the last twenty-four hours. Josh, I know you want to get going, so tell DC Kerrigan what we know so far while you&#x2019;re on the way.&#x201d;<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t like Godley to be vague. One of the things that made him an outstanding boss was his command of each twist and turn in every case his team worked. I hesitated for a second before following Derwent out of the room. It wasn&#x2019;t my place to ask the superintendent if he was okay. Besides, I had problems of my own. Derwent could have looked more thrilled at the prospect of working with me. Maybe he had heard something about me from someone else on the team. Maybe I had made a bad first impression. Maybe he was just in a bad mood. Sitting next to him in the squad car, it was difficult to tell.<br><br>&#x201c;Earth to DC Kerrigan. Come in, DC Kerrigan.&#x201d;<br><br>I jumped. &#x201c;Sorry. I was miles away.&#x201d;<br><br>Derwent had interrupted his monologue about other motorists&#x2019; shortcomings to ask me a question, and I&#x2019;d missed it. He was looking at me impatiently, tapping his fingers on the edge of the steering wheel as the lights in front of us stubbornly stayed red.<br><br>&#x201c;I asked you what you made of Godley&#x2019;s briefing. I thought you might have some insight to share.&#x201d; The sarcasm was biting and I managed not to wince. Just.<br><br>&#x201c;The boss didn&#x2019;t say much. Only that there were two similar deaths in the same area.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that didn&#x2019;t make you think? Didn&#x2019;t make you wonder what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know enough about either case yet to make any assumptions,&#x201d; I said levelly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to jump to conclusions without knowing the facts.&#x201d; <i>The facts you were supposed to share with me. . .&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s fair.&#x201d; Derwent was nodding as if I&#x2019;d passed a test I didn&#x2019;t know I was taking. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk through the facts. Yesterday evening, Mrs. Claudia Tremlett called her local police station to report her husband missing. Ivan Tremlett was a self-employed software designer who lived in Clapham, just off the Common. He rented office space down the road in Brixton because he had three small children and they made too much noise for him to be able to work from home. He had two rooms above a laundrette and it was his habit to lock himself in. He was extremely security conscious, not least because he had quite a lot of expensive computer equipment. He didn&#x2019;t see clients at his office so he wasn&#x2019;t set up to receive visitors. Mrs. Tremlett became concerned when he failed to return home by six o&#x2019;clock, because he always followed the same routine&#x2014;out in the morning by half past eight, back by half past five. She had tried to raise him by phone, but got no reply from the mobile or landline. Mrs. Tremlett was extremely distressed on the phone and worried about her husband&#x2019;s safety. She convinced the sergeant to dispatch a unit to check that all was well.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And it wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; I said knowing the answer.<br><br>&#x201c;It was not. Mr. Tremlett was in the office, all right, with his computers, but neither they nor he were in what you might call a viable condition. Mr. Tremlett&#x2019;s injuries were not compatible with life.&#x201d;<br><br>It was typical police understatement: the phrase generally meant someone who was so very dead it was hard to recognize them as having been human in the first place. &#x201c;Who took the case? Lambeth CID?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They did the initial work. Didn&#x2019;t take it too far&#x2014;they just took statements from the people working in the laundrette, and Mrs. Tremlett, and secured the scene. In fairness, they didn&#x2019;t have much of a chance to get stuck in, because this came in at lunchtime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This&#x201d; was the crime scene that was our eventual destination, if the traffic ever released us. But Derwent hadn&#x2019;t finished with the software designer yet.<br><br>&#x201c;The last time anyone heard from Tremlett was around two yesterday afternoon when he spoke to his wife. The computers had been smashed to bits, but we might be able to raise something off a hard disk to tell us when he last used them&#x2014;that could give us a better idea of when he was attacked, but let&#x2019;s say it was between two and five yesterday afternoon.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No witnesses?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not so far. No one in the laundrette heard or saw anything. It&#x2019;s a noisy place, apparently&#x2014;machines on the go all the time, people in and out. Besides, no one really knew Ivan Tremlett was there. He kept to himself, and his office had a separate entrance, so they wouldn&#x2019;t have seen him or anyone else coming and going.&#x201d; The car in front of us braked and Derwent&#x2019;s face lit up with a demonic glow. He grinned at me. &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s where it gets interesting.&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled politely in response. Interesting was neve...</p><h2>The Second Ship (The Rho Agenda)</h2><p><p>In 1948, an alien starship fell from the New Mexico sky&#x2014;and immediately vanished behind the walls of the Los Alamos Laboratory.

He later described this as the happiest, most content time of his troubled life. This period produced two works which are testament to his research and conclusions; they have very different histories.</p><p>Firstly, there was a series of articles written in Afrikaans for the newspaper <i>Die Vaderland</i>. They were then published in book form under the title <i>Burgers van die Berge</i>, and were first published in an English translation in 1939 under the title <i>My Friends the Baboons</i>. These pieces were written in a popular vein suitable to a newspaper readership, and were not regarded seriously by Marais himself. They are a journal; a series of anecdotes and impressions.</p><p><i>The Soul of the Ape</i>, which Marais wrote in wonderfully clear and precise English, was the more serious scientific document; however after his death in 1936, it could not be found. It was lost for 32 years, and was recovered in 1968, and published the following year.</p><p>The excellent introduction by Robert Ardrey that is included in this volume was part of the 1969 and subsequent editions of <i>The Soul of the Ape</i>, and adds greatly to an appreciation of its importance.</p><p>Together, these three texts give us as complete a picture as we will ever get of Marais&#x2019; three year study of these complex relatives of humanity, and its implications for the study of consciousness.</p><p>Eug&#x450;ne Marais is also the author of <i>The Soul of the White Ant</i>, his exploration of the psyche and social life of the termite. It was always his intention that the two bodies of work, on termites and apes, were companion pieces in the search for an understanding of the psyche that would span the gulf between the insect and primate worlds. The point of Marais&#x2019; work was, always, the mystery of consciousness itself, on which grounds it is as relevant as ever.</p>&#x201c;He offers a vision of nature as a whole, whose parts obey different time-laws, move in affinities and linkages we could learn to see: parts making wholes on their own level, but seen by our divisive brains as a multitude of individualities, a flock of birds, a species of plant or beast.

Ojibwes, French Canadians, Finns, Cornish, Poles, Italians, Slovenians, and others have all lived here, attracted to the area by its timber, mineral ore, and fishing grounds. Mixing local happenings with supernatural tales and creatively adapting traditional stories to suit changing audiences, the diverse inhabitants of the U.P. have created a wealth of lore populated with tricksters, outlaws, cunning trappers and poachers, eccentric bosses of the mines and lumber camps, &#x201c;bloodstoppers&#x201d; gifted with the lifesaving power to stop the flow of blood, &#x201c;bearwalkers&#x201d; able to assume the shape of bears, and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For folklorist Richard M. Dorson, who ventured into the region in the late 1940s, the U.P. was a living laboratory, a storyteller&#x2019;s paradise. <i>Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers</i>, based on his extensive fieldwork in the area, is his richest and most enduring work. This new edition, with a critical introduction and an appendix of additional tales selected by James P. Leary, restores and expands Dorson&#x2019;s classic contribution to American folklore. Engaging and well informed, the book presents and ponders the folk narratives of the region&#x2019;s loggers, miners, lake sailors, trappers, and townsfolk. Unfolding the variously peculiar and raucous tales of the U.P., <i>Bloodstoppers and Bearwalkers</i> reveals a vital component of Upper Midwest culture and a fascinating cross-section of American society.&nbsp;</p><p>Richard M.

Leary, from the new introduction</p><h2>The Most Beautiful Villages of Brittany</h2><p>Geography and geology have combined to make Brittany a land distinct from the rest of France. A place of dramatic contrasts, it occupies the great northwestern peninsula of the French landmass where a jagged coastline, fertile plains, and wild moorland lie beneath a sky by rapid turns sullen and sunny. A strong sense of separateness, reflected in the continuing strength of local village traditions, has remained a characteristic of the Bretons who, alone among the peoples of France, are Celts rather than Gauls. The architecture of the Breton villages is a testimony to centuries of religious piety: calvaries and ossuaries abound, including remarkable Gothic examples like those at Rochefort-en-Terre in Morbihan. Josselin in the same departement is home to a magnificent chateau with a Gothic inner facade generally hailed as a masterpiece of sculpture in granite. In Lehon, Cotes-du-Nord, you can stand and admire the ruined grandeur of its priory and chateau or, in Ille-et-Vilaine, explore the restored keep of Grand-Fougeray&#39;s thirteenth-century castle. The local houses are often built of granite, an ideal material for resisting the Atlantic winter storms. Though the ocean is sometimes a savage surround to the Breton peninsula, it also provides the seafood that makes any visit to the villages and small towns of Brittany a gastronomic delight. The sea yields succulent lobsters and langoustines, while the villages of the river estuaries enjoy mussels and oysters. Brittany&#39;s vigorous and varied village life and architecture are captured in James Bentley&#39;s perceptive commentaries and Hugh Palmer&#39;s stunning photographs. Complete with a traveler&#39;s guide, The Most Beautiful Villages of Brittany offers an evocative portrayal of the coastal and inland communities of this resilient land.</p><p>The latest installment of the lavishly illustrated Most Beautiful Villages series focuses on the picturesque hamlets of Brittany in northwest France. Written by James Bentley and photographed by Hugh Palmer, <i>The Most Beautiful Villages of Brittany</i> depicts the rich history of the proud and independent Bretons (who trace their ancestry back to the Celts). With 2,100 miles of coastline, the region's livelihood has forever been intertwined with a sometimes unforgiving sea, and the still-standing granite Romanesque homes and churches built centuries ago reflect the considerable Breton resilience. Well organized, the book is divided into four chapters, each dedicated to an area of Brittany (Finist�re, Morbihan, Ille-et-Vilaine and C�tes-d'Armor), with villages listed alphabetically. Highlights include Josselin's medieval fortifications, Treguier's unique half-timbered houses, the steeply pitched roofs in Becherel, and the stunning rock formations and sandy beaches found along the famous pink granite coast of Ploumanac'h'. Throughout the book are wonderful shots of harbors dotted with colorful fishing boats, charming flower-filled town squares, intricate stained glass, and windows adorned with delicate Brittany lace. The last chapter, "Traveller's Guide," lists practical information (hotels, restaurants), as well as downright necessities (local creperies). <i>--Jill Fergus</i><p><b>Hugh Palmer</b> is one of Britain&#x2019;s leading photographers of architecture and gardens.

Jon turns to basic Orthodox theology regarding the Trinity, the Incarnation, etc. as the foundation for our struggle in this battle. Finally, he explains the tools, or weapons, we may use to fight the good fight such as prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and living a virtuous life. These tools have been used in and encouraged by the Church for 2000 years. They are &#34;time-tested&#34;. Fr. Jon writes: &#34;We don&#39;t have to experiment.

Of the 2,208 people on board, only 712 survived. It&#x2019;s a well-known story, though maybe not to young readers, who, if anything, might have seen the movie. Hopkinson orchestrates a wealth of material here, using a third-person narrative voice to tell the story while incorporating eyewitness accounts of people on the &#x201c;most luxurious ship the world had ever seen.&#x201d; A huge number of archival photographs and reproductions of telegrams, maps, letters, illustrations, sidebars and even a dinner menu complement the text, yielding a volume as interesting for browsing as for through-reading. The voices include a stewardess, a science teacher, a 9-year-old boy, the ship&#x2019;s designer, the captain and a mother on her way to a new life in America. Best of all is the author&#x2019;s spirit: She encourages readers to think like historians and wonder what it would have been like on the <i>Titanic </i>and imagine each character&#x2019;s story. Fifty pages of backmatter will inform and guide readers who want to know even more.<br><br>A thorough and absorbing recreation of the ill-fated voyage.<i>(Nonfiction. 8-16)</i><br><br>-Kirkus Reviews January 1, 2012</p><br><br>As the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic approaches, there is a whole new output of books reexamining and updating the information about the tragedy. This one weaves together the memories and writing of the survivors, and what makes it stand out is the intimacy readers feel for the crew and passengers. The story itself hasn&#x2019;t changed, but through Hopkinson&#x2019;s work, young people get to know and care deeply about the people involved. Children, stewards, officers, and passengers from all three class designations are included, and their stories combine to recount the events of that fateful April night. Readers with even a passing knowledge of the Titanic will find themselves drawn into the drama and heartbroken at the inevitable end. Period photographs, artwork, diagrams, and maps appear throughout to illustrate points and help clarify events. Traditionally accepted details about the ship from its construction to its luxurious appointments, are discussed, and some of the controversies that have arisen since the wreck was found, but the real focus here is on the people and the narrative. Students looking for real-life drama will find this an absorbing and richly satisfying read.&#x2013;<i>Jody Kopple, Shady Hill School, Cambridge</i>, <i>MA</i><br><br>-School Library Journal, February 2012<br><p></p><br><br>Hopkinson knows precisely what&#x2019;s she doing in her coverage of the <i>Titanic</i> disaster: providing young readers with a basic introduction to the event without overdramatizing, drawing unwarranted conclusions, or prolonging the ordeal. She begins her account as the ship embarks on its maiden voyage and, once it sets sail, flashes back to cover its construction and grandeur as well as some of the crew&#x2019;s responsibilities, which play major roles in the sinking of the ship and the rescue of the passengers. Hopkinson also introduces her &#x201c;characters,&#x201d; real survivors whose voices relay many of the subsequent events. She includes crew members as well as those traveling in first, second, and third class, showing both the contrasts between them as the voyage begins and the horror that binds them by night&#x2019;s end. In this admirably restrained account, Hopkinson covers, but doesn&#x2019;t dwell upon, the foreshadowing of iceberg reports, the heartbreaking choices in boarding the (too few) lifeboats, and the agony of those dying in the freezing water. For interested readers who want to read in more detail, Hopkinson includes comprehensive chapter notes, a listing of sources, and questions to get young people started on their own <i>Titanic </i>quests. Archival photographs, a timeline, a selected list of facts, short biographies of those mentioned, excerpts from selected survivor letters, a glossary, and an unseen index complete this fine book. <br><br>-Betty Carter, Horn Book Reviews, March/April 2012<br><br><br>Hopkinson puts a human face on the Titanic&#x2019;s sinking in this riveting nonfiction chronicle of the ship&#x2019;s collision with an iceberg and the tragic aftermath. She threads together the stories of many passengers and crew members, focusing on a handful of survivors that includes an Argentine-born stewardess, a rambunctious nine-year-old British boy, a science teacher from England, and an American teenager traveling with his parents. The author quotes these four and others freely, their voices forming a deeply intimate account of the tragedy. Hopkinson packs her thoroughly researched story with a wealth of information about the ship itself (this book is an invaluable resource for students), and her portraits of the shipmates are fully realized and often heartbreaking. Chapters detailing the sinking, the scramble for lifeboats, and the harrowing wait for the Carpathia&#x2019;s arrival are fast-paced and riveting. Photos of the ship, the (purported) iceberg, telegrams sent to and from the Titanic, and of the survivors&#x2019; rescue add significant context and amplify the immediacy of the drama.

In <i>The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea,</i> and numerous short stories, he explored such universal themes as stoicism in adversity, as well as our futile struggles against nature and mortality.This evocative, sympathetic biography illuminates the events that informed Hemingway's vigorous life: an accident-prone youth and early rivalry with his father; his experiences in World War I, the Spanish Civil War, and World War II; his stormy relationships with writers and women; his sudden fame, slow decline, and suicide. Based on previously unavailable information and exclusive interviews, <i>Hemingway</i> enriches anyone's understanding and appreciation of America's most important twentieth-century writer.</p><p><b>Jeffrey Meyers</b>There was a cartoon famous some 35 years ago that depicted an editor returning a manuscript to a crestfallen author: "But you have a wonderful style; Hemingway's, isn't it?" In this critical bigraphy, Meyers, a professor at the University of Colorado and author of some 20 books, charts the life of the man who created that "wonderful," innovative style imitated by so many over the decades. It was virtually a new language, seemingly simplistic but carefully forged and intensely suggestive. Hemingway himself was flamboyant and hugely personable, and, in his prime, had the good looks of a movie star. The understated tone of his writing was identified with his image and an attitude toward life and loss that he seemed to exemplify. It is amazing that this Midwesterner, with only a high-school education, should, in his mid-20s, have been crony of the likes of Joyce, Pound and Gertrude Stein, as well as other literary notables who colored expatriate Paris after the Great War. Hemingway became not only the best known of the lot, but quite simply one of the most famous people in the world. He assiduously courted that fame and it was among the things that eventually undid him. Among the telling details in the life of this man, who created himself as the personification of maleness, is that his mother dressed him as twin to his sister until he was three. By five he was a "soldser" who, when asked what he was afraid of, would shout, " 'fraid of nothin." Norman Mailer, whom Meyers terms "the hip pocket Hemingway of our time," wrote sympathetically that Hemingway's life had been heroic, that he had struggled with cowardice always and that "his inner landscape was a nightmare. . . . It is possible that he carried a weight of anxiety with him that would have suffocated any man smaller than himself." Meyers's biography in no way replaces Carlos Baker's massive 1969 achievement, Ernest Hemingway: A Life Story, but it is marvelously rich in new, revealing anecdote and it deservedly stands beside Baker's as a saltier and less discreet companion volume.

He is a man of many hats: prose fiction writer, poet, translator, journalist, editor, anthologizer, satirist, translator, comic stage performer, playwright, and culinary specialist to name several that come to mind. He was designated a Golden Writer of Ukraine in 2012 and is one of the country&#39;s most prolific writers. His works have earned numerous prizes including the BBC Ukrainian Book of the Year Award twice for his novels Spring Games in Autumn Gardens (2005) and Tango of Death (2012). During his undergraduate days in Stanislaviv, Vynnychuk fell under the watchful eye of the KGB. In part to escape that surveillance, he moved to the larger city of Lviv after graduating in 1973. He continues to reside there to this day and has become one of the major champions of his adopted city. Until 1980 he was blacklisted from publishing under the repressive Soviet regime but managed still to do so under various pseudonyms. After emerging from the underground, Vynnychuk rose to swift popularity in Western Ukraine (Galicia) with his singing and performance group &#34;Don&#39;t Worry!&#34; (founded in 1987), his fantastic stories and novellas in his collection of shorter works The Flashing Beacon (1990), and his pulp fiction erotic novel Maidens of the Night (1992). Since then he has published scores of fiction and non-fiction books, anthologies, children&#39;s books, and translations. Controversy has followed Vynnychuk throughout his creative lifetime: in particular for his overt male perspective on eroticism in his writings as well as for his satirical jibes at political and cultural figures both in Soviet and post-Ukrainian-independence times. In 2012 he was vilified by elements of the corrupt and now thankfully former Yanukovych regime for his satirical poem &#34;Kill the Mother,&#34; which was circulated widely on the Internet. Vynnychuk&#39;s name more recently also was included in the infamous &#34;List of 47,&#34; which consisted of 47 prominent Ukrainian cultural and political figures targeted for assassination by Russian-backed killers. The novel Tango of Death with the city of Lviv as one of its main heroes represents the pinnacle of Vynnychuk&#39;s craft and showcases his superb stylistic mastery.</p><h2>Studies on the Foundation Stone Meditation</h2><p>In the unfolding of a true spiritual mission upon the Earth, the great teachers of humanity work together. An example of this working together to fulfill a spiritual mission for humanity is presented to us in this book. It is a matter in this work of a collaboration between two great spiritual teachers of humanity in the twentieth century: Rudolf Steiner (1861-1925) and Valentin Tomberg (1900-1973). Rudolf Steiner&#39;s life work culminated in the &#39;baptismal event&#39; for the Second Coming of Christ expressed in the Foundation Stone of Love and clothed in the words of the Foundation Stone meditation. Valentin Tomberg, after his spiritual awakening in 1932, entered into the Mystery of Christ&#39;s Second Coming. His Studies on the Foundation Stone Meditation, published in critical years of world history (1936-1939), were written just a few years after his spiritual awakening. They penetrate into the Mystery of Christ&#39;s Second Coming by offering the reader access from within to the Foundation Stone meditation given to humanity by Christ through Rudolf Steiner. Every sentence of these studies - born of living experience undergone by Valentin Tomberg - leads the reader into the sublime mystery of the spirit awakening of humanity through Christ in our time. Understood as a manual for enlightenment, to be worked with meditatively over and over again, this work is one of the great treasures of humanity&#39;s spiritual literature - a priceless jewel for every spiritual seeker in our time.</p><p></p><h2>The New Supply Chain Agenda: The 5 Steps That Drive Real Value</h2><p>Is your company delivering products to customers at the right time, place, and price with the best possible availability and lowest possible cost and working capital?

Mentzer<br> Introduction<br><br> You are shooting yourself in the foot. If yours is like the vast majority of the hundreds of companies we&#x2019;ve examined, then you have incentives in your organization that drive down shareholder value, waste money, and hurt customers and suppliers. Think for a moment about how your sales team and your product design team are incented. We can virtually guarantee that the sales team is encouraged to maximize product revenue and the product design team is encouraged to drive down product cost. Makes sense, right? How else would you do it?<br><br>Now stop to think about what those incentives really do to your costs and customer service. Those incentives encourage product and SKU proliferation; the resulting complexity drives up costs in purchasing, raw materials handling, manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution, not to mention the toll it takes on profitability because of stock-outs of hot products and excess inventory of slow-selling ones. That&#x2019;s what we call shooting yourself in the foot.<br><br>Essentially you have inadvertently decided to take a huge chunk of working capital and shareholder value and put it on a shelf to gather dust. This chunk of working capital certainly isn&#x2019;t working, unless you consider attaching a boat anchor to your share price working.&#x2019; Worse, you are encouraging your people to pile up more on the shelf every day.<br><br>Now think for a moment about what Toyota, Wal-Mart, Apple and Proctor and Gamble have in common aside from well-chronicled success in historically difficult industries? They all have driven superior shareholder value by dedicating themselves to supply chain excellence. Many executives would dismiss that statement. Supply chain is a cost center, they say. It has no direct relationship to shareholder value other than as a source of cost reduction.<br><br>The traditional view of the supply chain is a set of vertical functions such as warehousing and shipping, which don&#x2019;t seem to have direct bearing on earnings and cash flow. This view does not reflect the success of forward-thinking manufacturers and retailers across the globe. These firms have invested in supply chain management initiatives and have fundamentally improved their ability to deliver products to customers at the right time, place and price point, with the lowest possible cost and working capital. Companies that are leading their industries, gaining market share, and increasing shareholder value have transformed their supply chains from a set of independent vertical functions into a strategic, horizontal activity governing the flow of information and material from partners and suppliers through the functional silos of the firm and out to the customer.<br><br>The functions of logistics, procurement and warehousing have not gone away, of course. They are still part of the picture but they are no longer the entire picture. This new, broader view of the supply chain can bring dramatic results:<br><br>OfficeMax and their supplier Avery Dennison achieved major improvements due to their collaborative supply chain relationship, including a lead time reduction of 60 percent, forecast accuracy improvement of 30 percent, inventory reduction of 9% even though fill rates improved from 95 percent to 99 percent.<br><br>At Procter &amp; Gamble, a shift to 2X concentrated laundry detergent made major cost reductions in the supply chain by allowing the company to halve the size of its bottles and ship twice as many wash-loads in the same size truck. P&amp;G was clever enough to link product design to supply chain capability to dramatically lower shipping costs per bottle.<br><br>Small-town retail chain Stage Stores saved $2 million in annual distribution center costs by changing its compensation structure for buyers. Instead of rewarding them simply for staying within budget, they added the additional incentive to smooth their buying patterns, which prevented delivery peaks at the beginning of the month as well as end-of-month stock outs.<br><br>Whirlpool used its supply chain to attack working capital, and through supply chain initiatives cut its working capital by $600 million, freeing up critically needed capital inside the company rather than having to use the credit markets.<br><br>Coca Cola Bottling implemented new demand planning and inventory management software technology, and reduced inventory by 50%.<br><br>We collected these stories, and the dozens of others in the book through our work experience as supply chain executives with companies such as Whirlpool, OfficeMax, and General Motors, as well as through consulting work that all three of us have done; and that Tom Mentzer and Paul Dittmann are actively conducting as faculty members at the University of Tennessee. This database of best practice drawn from interaction with hundreds of companies provides compelling evidence that it is possible to delight the customer and still do what is best financially for the company and the shareholders. And the most effective way to do that is by viewing supply chain functions like inventory management and logistics as part of a constellation of activities including sales and customer service, merchandizing, product design, manufacturing, and procurement that work in tandem to deliver value to the customer. Supply chain excellence today involves collaboration across these organizational units to deliver outstanding customer availability at optimal inventory investment and cost levels.<br><br>This change is reflected in the more inclusive definition of supply chain offered by the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP). According to the CSCMP:<br>Supply chain encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion, and all logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes coordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be suppliers, intermediaries, third party service providers, and customers. Supply chain management integrates supply and demand management within and across companies.<br><br><b> Your Supply Chain and Its Impact on Shareholder Value<br> Chances are, if you have picked up this book you already feel that your supply chain is not delivering excellence, or that it could deliver more. Given the economic pressures brought on by the end of cheap energy, the increasingly global nature of manufacturing and retail competition, and the global Great Recession of 2008-2010, you probably are also looking for ways to unlock capital within your organization as an alternative to equity and debt.<br><br>Maybe you have never thought much about the supply chain before and are looking for new opportunities. Or maybe you have approved supply chain projects that produced disappointing returns. Either way, we assure you that true supply chain excellence, involving cross-organization and cross-company collaboration, can provide a sustainable way to reduce inventory and costs, while increasing customer fill rates and improving service levels. These actions translate into balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow improvements which together yield more economic profit for the firm and as we&#x2019;ll show, economic profit connects supply chain excellence directly to shareholder value.<br><br>Chapter One provides a detailed look at the connection between economic profit and supply chain excellence and how executives can point their supply chain team toward a focus on what is most important to the firm: growing shareholder value. In brief, the connection between economic profit, shareholder value and supply chain is based on the simple concept that capital always costs something. Sometimes the cost to the firm is quantifiable, like interest paid on debt, and sometimes it is less so, as when capital is locked up in inventory and not available for opportunistic investments. Economic profit is, simply, profit less the cost of capital needed to generate that profit, and it&#x2019;s a big deal because the higher a firm&#x2019;s economic profit, the more it is delivering returns above the cost of the capital invested. The greater those real returns, the more real value shareholders are getting for locking up their money in a business.<br><br>Most executives try to increase economic profit by pulling on some pretty traditional levers: by increasing sales through new product releases or promotions, or by cutting costs. After years of seeking economic profit through these approaches executives may find they have wrung all they can from them.<br><br>Supply chain excellence provides a new means to the same end one which has been largely neglected. This seems hard to believe given the extraordinary press in the past decade to the supply chain successes of companies such as Toyota and Wal-Mart. Yet these companies are viewed with awe expressly because their committed focus on supply chain excellence is still the exception rather than the rule. Unfortunately so, given that the benefits from supply chain excellence can compound over time, as improvements achieved from taking an expansive view of the supply chain apply not only to the year in which the improvement is made but to every year thereafter.<br><br>The goal of this book is not to convince you that it can be done it is to show you how to do it. We should know, since we have had to do it ourselves; and have discovered, sometimes the hard way, the basic elements along the pathway linking supply chain excellence, economic profit, and shareholder value.<br><br><b> The Authors<br>Reuben Sloan is currently Executive Vice President of Supply Chain at OfficeMax.

Tom has consulted for hundreds of companies over his career.<br><br>Collectively, our experience as supply chain professionals and academics have put us in contact with literally hundreds of companies, many of which have come to the University of Tennessee for in-depth supply chain audits, or have attended the supply chain forum sponsored by the University. Stories from those audits and forums have been collected into a 400-company strong database, from which the examples, stories and quotations used throughout the book, unless otherwise noted, are drawn.<br><br>Supply Chain Excellence Starts with a Strategy:<br>Our experiences with the firms we have audited, our consulting work, as well as our experiences as professionals at companies such as Whirlpool and OfficeMax, have allowed us to create a roadmap for companies to attain supply chain excellence. That roadmap begins, as we outline in Chapter Two, with the creation of a supply chain strategy.<br><br>The need for a strategy may seem obvious. Yet in the supply chain audits done by the University of Tennessee, almost no firm could produce a supply chain strategy with a multi-year road map to achieve excellence.<br><br>So what is a supply chain strategy? It is a set of actions that guides the firm&#x2019;s supply chain evolution for the next 3-5 years. The strategy creation must start with the customer&#x2019;s current and future needs, must comprehend the competitive threats, must recognize socio-economic and demographic scenarios, must account for the evolving technology and it must satisfy the economic profit goals of the company. Most importantly, it must do something: it must generate a set of actions that result in capabilities the firm needs.<br><br>All of that is pretty standard strategic planning stuff. But the supply chain strategy is special because the supply chain is a horizontal end-to-end process guiding the seamless flow of product across the extended enterprise. Products flow to customers from suppliers through the firm. But this flow must pass smoothly through vertical functional barriers. In addition, the requirements of the customer must guide the flow; and those requirements in the form of feedback and information must flow smoothly back through the firm&#x2019;s functional barriers.<br><br><b> Five Pillars of Supply Chain Excellence<br>We have identified five pillars of a supply chain strategy that best create the conditions for this two-way flow to happen. Each pillar is elaborated upon in a dedicated chapter. The five pillars of supply chain strategy are:<br><br> 1. Pick the Right Leaders and Develop Supply Chain Talent<br>Finding and developing the right talent is the number one pillar for a reason. Nothing is more important than having the right people with the right skills in the right jobs (Chapter Three).<br><br> 2. Keep Up with Supply Chain Technologies and Trends<br>The second component of supply chain excellence is the rapidly developing supply chain technology landscape (Chapter Four). It is useful to think of supply chain technology in four buckets: Software such as ERP and supply chain decision support systems; e-Business technologies such as EDI and Internet portals; Visibility technologies such as RFID; and Process Advances such as Lean and Six Sigma. Appropriate technology use is a key enabler of collaboration and of efficient execution of various supply chain functions.<br><br> 3. Eliminate Cross-Functional Disconnects That Cripple the Supply Chain<br>The third element recognizes that the supply chain process is the ultimate cross-functional process stretching from suppliers through the entire firm and then beyond to its customers (Chapter Five). As such, misalignment and miscommunication across functions can be absolutely crippling. SKU management is a classical cross-functional disconnect in most firms: operating functions feel the cost and weight of increased inventory caused by more SKUs, but Sales and Marketing feel they must appear innovative to their customers. In many companies, the actual value delivered by any given SKU is either unknown, or locked in systems that are not accessible by everyone least of all the designers responsible for coming up with new product. Coming to grips with this and other cross-functional dilemmas is a key to supply chain excellence.<br><br> 4. Collaborate with Suppliers and Customers<br>The fourth pillar focuses on building the seamless flow of products to the customer and the seamless flow of information back from the customer via collaborative relationships extending outside the walls of the firm (Chapter Six).

David Antram was born in Brighton, England, in 1958. He studied at Eastbourne College of Art and then worked in advertising for 15 years before becoming a full-time illustrator. He has since illustrated well over 100 titles, mainly for children and young adults, including around 60 in the bestselling &#39;You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Be&#39; series.Grade 4-6-Uniform, present-tense, "you are there" discussions. These titles are somewhat jovial in their portrayals of ghastly subject matters, downplaying the horrors of human sacrifice, for example. Cartoon characters are about to have a tree fall on them in Railroad and find frozen bodies in the water in Titanic. In Aztec Sacrifice, "you" are a captured warrior and end up having your heart cut out as an offering to the gods. Suggestions are made as to why a warrior would not be too scared, maybe because an herbal potion could make him feel drowsy and peaceful. Every spread offers a "Handy Hint" box. In Railroad, "you" are advised to "Steer clear of the saloons and casinos-." In Aztec Sacrifice, it is suggested that "you" make offers to your city's guardian god for protection. Of the three volumes, Aztec Sacrifice is the most gruesome and will therefore appeal to a certain clientele. Because of its ever-popular topic, Titanic will have no problem finding an audience. Because of its less-gory premise, Railroad might need to follow on the popularity of the other two titles. Heavily illustrated, colorful, and far from dull, these titles will have little trouble grabbing readers' interest.<br><i>Anne Chapman Callaghan, Racine Public Library, WI </i><br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Health Benefits of Medicinal Mushrooms</h2><p>Describes the most common supplemental medicinal mushrooms and their best clinical uses which includes treatment for hepatitis, cancer, and restoring the competency of the immune system.</p><p>Mark Stengler, N.M.D., is a licensed naturopathic medical doctor, the coauthor of Prescription for Drug Alternatives, and an expert in nutrition, herbal therapy, vitamin therapy, homeopathy, and integrative medicine.

He shows that Paul treats the Galatians&#39; possible abandonment of his gospel as putting at stake their fidelity to Christ.

Students, pastors, and other readers will appreciate the historical, literary, and theological insight offered in this practical commentary.</p><p>Peter Oakes and Andy Boakye provide a guide to the key ideas that have informed the study of Galatians, summarising the history of Galatians-scholarship and interacting with new arguments.<b>Critically Acclaimed Commentaries from Today's Top Scholars</b><br><br>"This excellent commentary sets Paul's letter effectively within its historical context, finely illuminates the text while well illustrating and contributing to the range of discussion on the letter within contemporary scholarship, and stimulatingly concludes each section by posing issues that should provide fruitful agendas for discussion groups."<br>--<b>James D.&nbsp;G.

She is an organizational-development consultant, executive coach, women&#x2019;s workshop leader, writer and musician. Her career, whether mediating, facilitating or coaching with groups or individuals, has always been about helping people find the path that evolves them to the next level of success. She believes that everyone&#x2019;s journey in work and life exists to transform them to a higher level of being. The challenge, however, is to not resist the change. Susanna sees herself as a guide and motivator in this transformational process. Susanna lives on a small farm in Maine along with her husband Robin, four overfed sheep, a one-eyed rooster, two chatty hens, Merlin the cross-eyed Maine Coon cat, and a wimpy one-hundred-pound dog named Max. She spends as much time as she can visiting her children and grandchildren. In her &#x201c;spare&#x201d; time, Susanna plays the keyboard and sings in a band, which has landed her in the Belly of the Whale more than once! She loves seeing every day as an adventure on her own life Journey.<br>You know you're in for a ride when a book starts with a woman--in this case, the author's then-21-year-old grandmother--tossing her suitcase from a moving train, then leaping herself. "She did what anyone following her dream would do," life coach Susanna Liller explains in the preface to <i>You Are a Heroine: A Retelling of the Hero's Journey</i>.<br><br>Fortunately, Liller's book doesn't encourage readers to jump out of vehicles. Rather, it's designed to "awaken the Heroine" in ordinary women and help them reach their potential in areas ranging from career and parenting to social activism. "The Heroine's Journey," she writes, "is ultimately all about the Heroine allowing herself to become herself."<br><br>Building on the work of the late author Joseph Campbell, who linked classical myths to common psychological themes, Liller guides readers with chapter-by-chapter steps of the Journey, such as the "Call," which represents the urge to do something different; learning to interact with major characters like naysayers and supporters, and coming to grips with figurative dragons that represent deep fears and challenges. Three real-life heroines--women who've seen their share of life-changing events, from divorce to chronic illness--share stories throughout, and their motivational quotes appear at the beginning of each chapter along with Campbell's. Writing exercises are embedded in the prose.<br><br>With occasional references to Dorothy from <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, Liller also gives relatable examples of her personal Journey milestones, including how the shock of having a pet project put on the back-burner by the boss quickly led to a new self-employment venture.<br><br>The author's straightforward, conversational writing is a pleasure, but it's her ability to help women interpret their circumstances in a more adventurous, intuitive way that makes this book unique. While male heroes have been traditionally defined by their physical battles, "Heroineism," she writes, "is about having the courage to expand from within." <i>The Heroine's Journey</i> gives us a fresh way of seeing just how far we can go.<br><br><b>Highly recommended</b> for fans of Joseph Campbell.<i><br>- BlueInk Starred Review</i><br>Heroines are needed now more than ever, and Liller's self-help book uses classic paradigms to show women how to unlock their own heroic powers.<br><br>Myth and theory come to life in Susanna Liller's You Are a Heroine: A Retelling of the Hero's Journey as courageous women relate how they let go of the familiar in order to seek out freedom on their own terms.<br><br>Popularized by Joseph Campbell in 1949, the Hero's Journey is a universal template for personally evolving from humdrum conformity toward an extraordinary life. It follows a familiar pattern but is unique to each individual. This pattern is interpreted for women by Liller: The heroine has an experience or receives a "call" that removes her from all that is familiar; she is placed in a new, even dangerous situation to face tasks that demand that she change and grow. She emerges a fully realized woman, able to offer her gifts to the world.<br><br>"The point of the Heroine's Journey is to birth you into your real self, the self you may have been holding back," writes Liller. Her book illuminates the characteristic stages of the path--including the adversaries and helpers met along the way, from the "Threshold Guardians" whose job is to dissuade the adventurer and fill her mind with doubt, to the "Mentors" or "Magical Helpers" who appear as guides. It will not be easy; the "Belly of the Whale" is a place of turmoil and confusion, and there will be "Dragons" (deep-seated beliefs and roadblocks) to be faced. Liller writes that a woman's Journey will be different from that of a man; for example, when men encounter "Dragons," they tend to fight them, while women seek to befriend, understand, transform, and integrate them.<br><br>Comforting, encouraging, and compassionate in tone, the book honors women's right to choose whether or not to embark upon the Heroine's Journey while also emphasizing its role in personal growth. Engaging the imagination, it includes fun, interactive tasks, a printable map of the Journey with guiding principles for accepting and responding to its challenges, downloadable audio of interviews with others on the path, and an intuition-based strategy for engaging with the tasks in a spirit of play and discovery. Myths, legends, and contemporary stories come together to provide the necessary background and context for each woman adventurer to feel she is taking her place in a worthy lineage, one marked by authenticity, audacity, and power.<br><br>In a society ruled mainly by men, geared to favor their attitudes and needs and brought to the brink of disaster by their unwillingness to take action on behalf of the planet and all its creatures, Liller encourages women to share their stories with each other to "create a groundswell of women remembering who they really are." The Heroine's Journey issues a clear and compelling challenge to women: become the heroine of your own journey. It is always worthwhile.<br><i>- Foreword Reviews</i><br><br><i>You Are A Heroine: A Retelling of the Hero's Journey </i>by Susanna Liller is a book for women and is designed to awaken the heroine inevery woman.

The meaningful distinction today is not between Protestant and Catholic, or Baptist and Episcopalian, but rather between "legalistic" and "nonlegalistic" religion, between the Church of Law and the Church of Love. On one side is the fundamentalist right, which draws a sharp distinction between "saved" and "unsaved" and worships a God of wrath and judgment; on the other are more mainstream Christians who view all humankind as children of a loving God who calls them to break down barriers of hate, prejudice, and distrust.<br><br>Pointing out that the supposedly "traditional" beliefs of American fundamentalism--about which most mainstream Christians, clergy included, know shockingly little--are in fact of relatively recent origin, are distinctively American in many ways, and are dramatically at odds with the values that Jesus actually spread, Bawer fascinatingly demonstrates the way in which these beliefs have increasingly come to supplant genuinely fundamental Christian tenets in the American church and to become synonymous with Christianity in the minds of many people.<br><br><b>Stealing Jesus</b> is the ringing testament of a man who is equally disturbed by the notion of an America without Christianity and the notion of an American Christianity without love and compassion.</p><p>In 300-odd pages, Bruce Bawer has opened a floodgate of incisive religious criticism that will reverberate across the American political scene. He has put into eloquent and decisive language what many mainline Christians and non-Christians have quietly suspected but been unable to verbalize--namely that Fundamentalist Christianity is barely Christian at all. A Baptist theologian says he is &#34;not interested in who Jesus was.&#34; Pat Robertson argues the Golden Rule as Jesus&#39;s justification that &#34;individual self-interest is being a very real part of the human makeup, and something not necessarily bad or sinful.&#34; In page after page, Bawer reveals a so-called Fundamentalist movement that readily displays a blatant disregard for the most salient message of the Gospels: selfless love and service to all. As for the significance of this revelation in the face of the ballooning presence of Fundamentalist Christians in American politics, readers will have to decide for themselves."Bawer's graceful prose and lucid insights make this a must-read book for anyone concerned with the relationship of Christianity to contemporary American culture."<br>--Publishers Weekly (starred review)<br><br>"Passionately outspoken, impeccably researched, and cogently reasoned, Stealing Jesus exposes the great danger posed to Christianity today by fundamentalism. A groundbreaking book."<br>--Library Journal<br><br>"So long, Bawer says, as the national media go on regarding fundamentalists as harmless or marginalso long, indeed, as they are allowed to get away with the preposterous assertion that they stand for Christian fundamentalstheir power and danger can only grow. We badly need a wake-up call, and [Bawer] intends to deliver it. . . . Stealing Jesus may prove of value simply for its clear exposition of what todays American fundamentalists believe and want to do. Bawers readers will no longer be able to greet that term with a condescending smile."<br>--Walter Kendrick, New York Times Book Review<br><br>"This book is an adventure in American religious thought, exciting and intelligent."<br>--Booklist<br><br>"Bawer lauds liberal Christianity as the essence of the Gospel, the kind of religion that Jesus would both recognize and practice because he preached it. This is a passionate, articulate, timely, and utterly useful book."<br>--Peter J.

Created in close collaboration with the artist on the occasion of her mid-career survey at the Whitney Museum of American Art, this inventive and comprehensive&nbsp;book features an incisive introduction by Scott Rothkopf, critical essays, literary texts,&nbsp;and short commentaries on a variety of subjects related to Owens&#x2019;s broad interests, which range from folk art and needlework to comics and wallpaper.<br><br> Reflections by more than twenty of Owens&#x2019;s fellow artists, collaborators, assistants, dealers, family members, and friends offer an array of perspectives on her work at different periods in her life, beginning with her high school years in Ohio and ending with her current exhibition. A rich trove of more than a thousand images, drawn from the artist&#x2019;s personal archive and largely unpublished before now, includes personal correspondence, journals, academic transcripts, handwritten notes, source material, exhibition announcements, clippings, and installation photographs.&nbsp;<br><br> Strikingly, each copy also features a unique silk-screen cover printed in Owens&#x2019;s studio, giving readers the opportunity to own an original work of art.

It documents Ms. Owens&#x2019;s thinking and working processes, her artistic community and the nuts and bolts of her career, starting with typed letters and proceeding to email and text exchanges with dealers and curators, even those for this show.

She is one of the great creations of all literature and has a secure place beside her two compatriots, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.<br><br>This Spanish classic, the greatest of the forebears of Cervantes, was originally published anonymously, in 1499; later editions bear the name of Fernando de Rojas as author, in acrostics.<br><br>Readers familiar with Lesley Byrd Simpson's translations of <i>Two Novels of Mexico</i> by Manuel Azuela, <i>The Poem of the Cid,</i> and <i>Little Sermons on Sin: The Archpriest of Talavera</i> will not be surprised that he has preserved the vigor and colloquial flavor of the original.<br><i>Notes on the edition, from the translator's preface:</i><br>The Burgos edition of 1499 [the earliest surviving edition and the one upon which this translation was based] was published anonymously. After 1501 the name of Fernando de Rojas appears in acrostics as the author; but he, or whoever it was, "corrected" the text by interpolating long passages that mercilessly elaborate the obvious, and then, in an apparent attempt to kill the work altogether, he inserted, between the death of Calisto and its discovery by Melibea (who is standing on the other side of the wall from which he falls to his death), five new acts! These additions are not without merit, but I am convinced that the original author could hardly have been a party to the violence thus done to the austere structure of his narrative. In short, all the interpolations and additions are impertinent and obtrusive, and I have omitted them and based my translation on the primitive text. The author, or, more likely, the early publishers, slavishly imitating Classic models, thought fit to introduce each act with an "argument," which, besides being dull, strikes me as an unnecessary piece of cluttering and I have omitted it.</p><p><b>Lesley Byrd Simpson </b>was a renowned translator of many great works of Spanish literature. His translations of <i>The Celestina </i>and <i>The Poem of the Cid </i>(both UC Press books) in particular preserve the vigor and colloquial flavor of the original."A vibrantly alive work of art . . . It is no exaggeration to equate the artistic originality and conquests of Rojas with the achievements of Cervantes, Velazquez, or Goya."&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Juan Goytisolo, from the Introduction&nbsp;<br> </b><br> "Without&nbsp;<i>Celestina</i>, the great tradition of the novel in Spanish would not exist: the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, and Juan Goytisolo all descend from Mother Celestina.

Who knows, as Leda I might have been the mother of Helen--or, as Anne, the mother of Mary.... I was also crippled shepherd in thrall of Saint Teresa of Avila; an Irish stable boy and a maker of stained glass at Chartres.... I saw the first performance of</em> Hamlet <em>and the last performance of Moliere, the actor. I was a friend to Oscar Wilde and an enemy to Leonardo.... I am both male and female. I am ageless, and I have no access to death."</em></blockquote><p>On April 15, 1912--ironically the very date on which more than a thousand people lost their lives as the <em>Titanic</em> sank--a figure known only as Pilgrim tries to commit suicide by hanging himself from a tree. When he is found five hours later, his heart miraculously begins beating again. This isn't his first attempt to end his life, and it is decided that steps must be taken to prevent Pilgrim from doing himself further harm.</p><p>Escorted by his beloved friend, Lady Sybil Quartermaine, Pilgrim is admitted to the famous Burgholzi Psychiatric Clinic in Zurich, where he will begin a battle of psyche and soul with Carl Jung, the self-professed mystical scientist of the unconscious--who is also a slave to his own sexual appetites.</p><p>Hungry for intellectual and spiritual challenge, Jung is fascinated by this compelling and enigmatic patient who refuses to speak. Slowly, though, Jung coaxes him to reveal the astonishing story of his existence. Pilgrim claims to be ageless and sexless, having lived as both male and female for four thousand years. Asserting that he has witnessed the greatest events of human history, he recounts his involvement with numerous figures who have shaped world culture, including Leonardo da Vinci, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James.</p><p>For Jung, probing this patient's mind proves a challenge that is both frustrating and enlightening. Is Pilgrim delusional? Are his memories only dreams or something far more fantastic? Is it madness or a miracle? These interactions with Pilgrim have a profound and unexpected effect on the esteemed and controversial doctor's own life and sanity, for his dreams soon become entwined with those of his patient's, while the anchor of his soul, his marriage, begins to disintegrate. The puzzle called Pilgrim will seemingly lead either to Jung's salvation--or his damnation.</p><p>Beautifully written, deeply evocative, and filled with a fascinating cast of historical characters, <em>Pilgrim</em> is both a richly layered story of a man's search for his own destiny and an absorbing, mind-expanding novel that explores the timeless questions of humanity and consciousness.</p></p><p>Timothy Findley's <i>Pilgrim</i> is the story of a man who can't die even though he tries over and over to kill himself. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, in 1912 he's placed in a Zurich clinic where Carl Gustav Jung is hard as work trying to determine the perimeter of the collective unconscious. For Jung, this man becomes an embodiment of the psyche's mystery. Claiming to have no past history but to have simply arrived one day at consciousness, Pilgrim lives in a limbo outside individuality and subjectivity. He's everyone and no one. Is he a messenger? Or is he a basket case? As the novel gathers momentum, we realize that Pilgrim is a character much like Virginia Woolf's Orlando, traversing gender and time, a witness. But whereas Woolf is a feverish and emotional writer, Findley is philosophical and dry, playful and slightly pretentious. Imagining conversations between Pilgrim and Henry James, Leonardo da Vinci, and Oscar Wilde, this novel is like a party full of beautiful guests. Or a safe train trip through an exotic landscape of consciousness where men use cologne that smells like "<i>moss... lemons... ferns</i>" and schizophrenics are elegant and well dressed, like the old countess who believes she lives on the moon and asks her doctor, "Is this a ballroom? Am I being courted?" <i>--Emily White</i><p>Timothy Findley's recent titles include <em>Pilgrim</em>, which was a finalist for the Giller Prize and his first published in the United States; <em>You Went Away</em>; <em>Dust to Dust</em>; and <em>The Piano Man's Daughter</em>. He was also the author of the acclaimed <em>Headhunter</em>, <em>Not Wanted on the Voyage</em>, <em>Famous Last Words</em>, and <em>The Wars</em>. His most recent play, <em>Elizabeth Rex</em>, won the Governor General's Award for Drama. His work has won innumerable honors, including the Governor General's Award for Fiction and the Edgar Award.

He was an Officer of the Order of Canada and, in France, Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. He split his time between homes in Stratford, Ontario and the south of France.

But instead of ushering in a shining era of prosperity and progress, the return of the silver engenders a new cycle of violence as Costaguana erupts in civil war, initiated by rival warlords determined to seize the mine and its riches. In desperation, Gould turns to the only man who can save the mine&#x2019;s treasure&#x2015;Nostromo, the incorruptible head of the local dockworkers, who protects the silver from rebel forces by taking it out to sea.

A compelling adventure story, it is also a novel of profound psychological insight and of powerful political implications. It tells the story of a Central American state whose silver mine serves both literally and metaphorically as the source of the country&#x2018;s value. Written at the time of the development of the Panama Canal, <em>Nostromo</em> is set in the imaginary province of Sulaco, which secedes from the federation of Costaguana in order to protect its natural resource, the silver mine. The parallels with the &#x2018;revolution&#x2019; fomented in Panama by the United States in 1903 are striking; just as Panama seceded from Columbia to satisfy the material interests of the canal builders, so the secession of Sulaco serves the material interests of &#x2018;the Gould concession.&#x2019; In this edition a variety of documents from the period (including material concerning American involvement in Central America in the early twentieth century, early critical notices, and family letters of Conrad&#x2019;s) help to set the text in context. </p></p><h2>Commentarii: Volume I: Bello Gallico cum A.

Banks</h2><p>In this first modern biography of Nathaniel P. Banks, James G. Hollandsworth, Jr., reveals the complicated and contradictory nature of the man who called himself the "fighting politician." Despite a lack of formal education, family connections, and personal fortune, Banks (1816&#x2013;1884) advanced from the Massachusetts legislature to the governorship to the U.S. Congress and Speaker of the House. He learned early in his political career that the pretext of conviction can be more important than the conviction itself, and he practiced a politics of expedience, espousing popular beliefs but never defining beliefs of his own. A leader in the new Republican party, he developed a reputation as a compelling orator and a politician with a bright future. <p>At the onset of the Civil War, Lincoln appointed Banks a major general, and, as Hollandsworth shows, the same pretext of conviction that served Banks so well in politics proved disastrous on the battlefield. He suffered resounding defeats in the 1862 Shenandoah Valley Campaign, the Battle of Cedar Mountain, and the Red River Campaign. Illuminating the personal characteristics that stalled the promise of Banks&#x2019;s early political career and contributed to his dismal record as a commanding officer, Hollandsworth demonstrates how Banks&#x2019;s obsessive pretense of glory prevented him from achieving its reality.</p></p><p><p>James G. Hollandsworth, Jr., is also the author of The Louisiana Native Guards: The Black Military Experience during the Civil War and An Absolute Massacre: The New Orleans Race Riot of July 30, 1866. He lives in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>Nathaniel P. Banks is generally known as the quintessential political general of the Civil War, his only rival for that dubious distinction being Benjamin Butler (see Chester G. Hearn's <i>When the Devil Came Down to Dixie</i> ). Of working-class origins and largely self-educated, Banks rose politically to become Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and that state's governor before the war. He was then immediately appointed a major general of volunteers, without having any military education whatever, and unfortunately made no effort to remedy the deficiency. The result was responsibility for three bloody Union defeats--in the Shenandoah Valley, along the Mississippi, and on the Red River--which were not redeemed by his pro-Negro efforts in governing New Orleans or his abortive postwar political career. Not, however, completely unattractive, Banks was ultimately an opportunist whose ambitions exceeded his abilities, disastrously for those called to serve under him. Hollandsworth's inspection of him should prove useful to most Civil War collections. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Old-House Dictionary: An Illustrated Guide to American Domestic Architecture (1600-1940)</h2><p>Old-House Dictionary From a One Room Cabin to a Beaux-Arts Mansion.Here's a concise and easily understandable architectural dictionaryfor professionals and amateurs alike.

Many compelling questions, of interest to anyone involved in adolescence research, remain unanswered. To what extent do family experiences influence the way one navigates through emerging adulthood? How do we begin to understand the interplay between adolescents' contexts and their development and well-being? <br><br><em>Adolescence and Beyond: Family Processes and Development </em>offers an accessible synthesis of research, theories, and perspectives on the family processes that contribute to development. Chapters from expert researchers cover a wide variety of topics surrounding the link between family processes and individual development, including adolescent romantic relationships, emotion regulation, resilience in contexts of risk, and socio-cultural and ethnic influences on development. Drawing on diverse research and methodological approaches that include direct family observations, interviews, and narrative analyses, this volume presents cutting-edge conceptual and empirical work on the key developmental tasks and challenges in the transition between adolescence and adulthood. Researchers, practitioners, and students in social, developmental, and clinical psychology--as well as those in social work, psychiatry, and pediatrics--will find this book an invaluable summary of important research on the link between family process and individual development.<br></p><p><br><strong>Patricia Kerig, Ph.D</strong>. is a Professor and the Director of Clinical Training in the Department of Psychology at the University of Utah.

They are Washington Irving&#39;s best pieces from THE SKETCH BOOK,first published in 1819-1820, and considered by many to be the best he ever wrote. The text for this handsome new edition is based upon the Author&#39;s Revised Edition of 1848....In 1848, the American Art Union published a special edition of Rip Van Winkle for its members with six illustrations designed and etched by Felix O. C. Darley (1822-1888), the Philadelphia-born artist whose work had already been seen and enjoyed by a very wide American public. In the following year six new Darley illustrations for The Legend of Sleepy Hollow were published in a similar special edition. These twelve are the high point in illustrations for Irving&#39;s works. This volume reproduces for the first time all twelve illustrations in full color.

His A History of New York, published in 1809 under the name of Diedrich Knickerbocker, was a satirical history of New York that spanned the years from 1609 to 1664. Under another pseudonym, Geoffrey Crayon, he wrote The Sketch-book, which included essays about English folk customs, essays about the American Indian, and the two American stories for which he is most renowned--&#34;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&#34; and &#34;Rip Van Winkle.&#34; Irving served as a member of the U.S. legation in Spain from 1826 to 1829 and as minister to Spain from 1842 to 1846. Following his return to the U.S. in 1846, he began work on a five-volume biography of Washington that was published from 1855-1859. Washington Irving died in 1859 in New York.</p><h2>Project Identification: The first scientific field study of UFO phenomena</h2><p>A survey of UFO phenomena--complete with photographs, diagrams, and statistical tables--reports on and evaluates the findings of the first scientific field study</p><p></p><h2>Early-Stage Technologies: Valuation and Pricing (Intellectual Property-General, Law, Accounting &amp; Finance, Management, Licensing, Special Topics)</h2><p>Comprehensive coverage of the issues, methods, and art of valuing and pricing early-stage technologies To develop or not to develop; to license or not to license; what price will be a true reflection of the product&#39;s value from both the buyer&#39;s and seller&#39;s point of view? These questions are crucial to companies dependent on intellectual property-particularly technology companies, universities, and biotech companies. The risks associated with early-stage technology are high, and decisions must often be made years before any potential product will reach the market. In Early-Stage Technologies: Valuation and Pricing, Richard Razgaitis presents TR-R-A-DE(TM), a comprehensive approach to determining the future of new technologies based on technology rights, risk assignment, the art of deal-making, and deal economics. He considers the key components involved in a licensing transaction, offers a detailed presentation of six valuation methods for intellectual property, examines risk in both quantitative and qualitative terms, and explores the negotiation strategy and structuring of agreements that are the keys to the art of technology rights deal-making. Early-Stage Technologies is an indispensable tool for anyone involved in the development, valuation, and licensing of intellectual property, the most valuable resource and driving force of the information age.</p><p>How is it possible to develop a licensing or purchase value for early-stage technology rights when there are no present customers, no historical data, no cash-flow data, and no demonstration of whether the technology in question will produce the next iMac or the next Edsel? What methods and criteria can potential buyers and sellers use to determine the value and appropriate price of products that are ahead of their time? Early-Stage Technologies is a comprehensive guide to technology risk assessment, valuation, and pricing. It describes in great detail the core concepts, sources of value, methods of valuation, issues involving equity realizations, and overall negotiation strategies to facilitate the licensing or sale of early-stage technologies; and it helps the developers of R&amp;D to value their technologies based on their own needs and arrive at a price that is acceptable to both themselves and the potential buyer/licensee. Drawing on his own diverse experience in developing, valuing, and licensing intellectual property, author Richard Razgaitis presents a realworld grounded approach to six key methods of valuing technology: use of industry standards, ratings/rankings method, rules of thumb, discounted cash flow, Monte Carlo and other advanced methods, and auctions. He describes the possible components involved in a licensing transaction: rights and other sources of value conveyed by the seller and money and other sources of value conveyed by the buyer, as well as a treatment of risks inherent in future projections. Finally, he explores how the value of licensing agreements can be structured and the principles upon which these structures can be negotiated. For licensing executives, corporate R&amp;D departments, intellectual property consultants, university and government laboratories, attorneys, accountants, and business appraisers and executives, Early-Stage Technologies is a valuable resource that helps minimize uncertainties, characterize risks, and develop rational pricing models so that promising technologies are given every chance to realize their full potential.RICHARD RAZGAITIS is a consultant in licensing and technology commercialization.

And although he is favorably compared with Franz Kafka, Samuel Beckett, and Robert Musil, it is only in recent years that he has gained a devoted cult following in America.<br> <br> A powerful, compact novella, <i>Walking</i> provides a perfect introduction to the absurd, dark, and uncommonly comic world of Bernhard, showing a preoccupation with themes&#x2014;illness and madness, isolation, tragic friendships&#x2014;that would obsess Bernhard throughout his career. <i>Walking</i> records the conversations of the unnamed narrator and his friend Oehler while they walk, discussing anything that comes to mind but always circling back to their mutual friend Karrer, who has gone irrevocably mad. Perhaps the most overtly philosophical work in Bernhard&#x2019;s highly philosophical oeuvre, <i>Walking</i> provides a penetrating meditation on the impossibility of truly thinking.</p></p><p><b>Thomas Bernhard</b> (1931-89) grew up in Salzburg and Vienna, where he studied music. In 1957 he began a second career as a playwright, poet, and novelist. He went on to win many of the most prestigious literary prizes of Europe (including the Austrian State Prize, the Bremen and Br�chner prizes, and Le Prix S�guier), became one of the most widely admired writers of his generation, and insisted at his death that none of his works be published in Austria for seventy years, a provision later repealed by his half-brother. <b>Kenneth J. Northcott</b> is professor emeritus of German at the University of Chicago. He has translated a number of books for the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;There&#x2019;s very little peace to be found within the minds of the characters of Austrian author Bernhard&#x2019;s celebrated philosophical novella <i>Walking</i>. It&#x2019;s not the easiest of reads&#x2014;an account of the conversations between the unnamed narrator and his friend and walking companion Oehler, the two men&#x2019;s discussion inevitably drawn back to that of the fate of a mutual friend of theirs, Karrer, who recently went mad and is now in an asylum&#x2014;but there&#x2019;s an absurd humour lurking between the lines.&#x201d; (Lucy Scholes <i>Independent (UK)</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;[#1 of the 10 funniest books]. . . . Bernhard&#x2019;s oeuvre is the longest, funniest joke in literature. If I were being honest this list would probably consist of nine Bernhard books and maybe one by Beckett. But I&#x2019;ll go with this novella for its extremely long, hysterically funny description of Karrer&#x2019;s mental breakdown in a clothing store, when he tries to convince a salesman, at some length, that the pants they are selling, when held up to the light, display a number of thin spots that can only be attributed to the use of shoddy materials, materials which Karrer insists (for page after page after page) must be what he refers to as &#x2018;Czechoslovakian rejects.&#x2019;&#x201d; (Adam Ehrlich Sachs <i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Walking</i> is indispensible Bernhard, a novella that can go toe to toe with his finest novels. At a brisk eighty-six pages, it&#x2019;s also a great entry point for readers who haven&#x2019;t yet made time for Bernhard. All of his obsessions and stylistic mannerisms&#x2014;the things that make Bernhard Bernhard&#x2014;are on full display here. . . . As is usual with Bernhard, the ceaseless pessimism is actually very comic, and as Oehler and the narrator continue to state positions on the slow death of intellectualism and thinking, the narrative ramps toward one of the greatest moments in all of literature, . . . eighteen pages of brutal hilarity.&#x201d; (<i>Rain Taxi Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;What is extraordinary about Bernhard is that his relentless pessimism never seems open to ridicule; his world is so powerfully imagined that it can seem to surround you like little else in literature.&#x201d; (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Our precious individual lives, we discover, are only a symptom of a swirling, uncentered excess of thought in which we lose our direction and identity. We lose ourselves into madness, we find, not at the end of reason&#x2019;s course but in the infinity between two beats of reason&#x2019;s clock. It is Bernhard&#x2019;s genius to be able to make this revelation darkly, but giddily, humorous. Kenneth J. Northcott&#x2019;s translation brilliantly renders the drama of this piece, which reads like a soliloquy revealing the complex inner tides constituting an individual psyche<i>. . . .</i> Uncompromising.&#x201d; (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Walking</i>, we see burgeoning signs of one of the most distinct literary voices of the twentieth century. . . . A small treasure.&#x201d; (<i>Rain Taxi</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The writing is . . . repetitive, but the repetition eventually seduces the reader into the strange nature of the friends&#x2019; discussion. Despite its difficulties, the writing is beautiful; even if you don&#x2019;t enjoy weighty writing or agree with Bernhard&#x2019;s sometimes heavy-handed views on society, the prose can be appreciated for is beauty alone.&#x201d; (<i>Bookslut</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;It is with <i>Walking</i>, worth the price of admission, that we understand how Bernhard&#x2019;s writing, a writing constantly struggling <i>against</i>, is a consistent, desperate, humorous, bitter, and all-too-human attempt to keep from going under.&#x201d; (<i>Review of Contemporary Fiction</i>)</p><h2>The Land-Grant Colleges and the Reshaping of American Higher Education (Perspectives on the History of Higher Education)</h2><p><p>This work provides a critical reexamination of the origin and development of America&#x2019;s land-grant colleges and universities, created by the most important piece of legislation in higher education. The story is divided into five parts that provide closer examinations of representative developments.</p> <p>Part I describes the connection between agricultural research and American colleges. Part II shows that the responsibility of defining and implementing the land-grant act fell to the states, which produced a variety of institutions in the nineteenth century. Part III details the first phase of the conflict during the latter decades of the nineteenth century about whether land colleges were intended to be agricultural colleges, or full academic institutions. Part IV focuses on the fact that full-fledged universities became dominant institutions of American higher education. The final part shows that the land-grant mission is alive and well in university colleges of agriculture and, in fact, is inherent to their identity.</p> <p>Including some of the best minds the field has to offer, this volume follows in the fine tradition of past books in Transaction&#x2019;s Perspectives on the History of Higher<em> </em>Education series.</p></p><p><p>Roger L.

James Bond and Swiss agent Fredericka &#x201c;Flicka&#x201d; von Grusse are immediately called in to investigate. <p>While at Laura&#x2019;s funeral, Bond notices among the wreaths a perfect white rose, its petals tipped blood-red and an ambiguous note wired to the stem. His investigation reveals an identical rose and note at the funerals of four high-profile personalities, all assassinated within a week. With no group claiming responsibility for the deaths, Bond focuses on Laura&#x2019;s case. He uncovers her recently dissolved love affair with the world-famous actor David Dragonpol, now an eccentric collector of theater memorabilia living in a castle on the Rhine. So Bond and Flicka go undercover to search the castle for clues, and in the garden find roses just like the ones at each of the funerals.</p><p>Their startling discovery leads to a harrowing manhunt in which the hidden identity of the serial killer is revealed.</p></p><p>John Gardner wrote, like Ian Fleming, fourteen James Bond novels (1981 to 1996). In all Gardner had fifty-five novels to his credit&#x2015;many of them bestsellers (his novel Maestro was a New York Times Notable Book of the Year). John Gardner died in 2007. Visit his estate&#x2019;s website at www.john-gardner.com.Like Pentagon dinosaurs laboring to adapt to a new world order by finding telltale traces of the old in every dark shadow, Gardner's reincarnation of James Bond examines a string of serial killings and finds a freelance terrorist just as dangerous as his old adversaries from SMERSH and SPECTRE. Bond's called in when MI5 agent Laura March is killed at Interlaken. Going through the things in her hotel room, he and Flicka Von Gr sse, his leggy opposite number from Swiss Intelligence, find a disturbing letter from Laura to her late brother, a serial beheader of blonds, and fax a copy back to M. While they're coupling in Bond's room, the letter itself is stolen, and M, citing the ``grave moral scandal'' (so much for updating Bond's morality), ostensibly removes Bond from duty. Back in England for Laura's funeral, Bond notices a bizarre floral tribute--a red-tipped white rose--linking Laura's death to four other recent assassinations, and to the flower's only breeder: Maeve Horton, sister of Laura's onetime fianc , distinguished actor David Dragonpol. There follow the requisite scenes of tourist-trap mayhem--at Schloss Drache, Dragonpol's Alpine aerie, atop the roof of the Duomo in Milan, and at EuroDisney, where the murderer has planned one last, ultra-high-profile strike--but Gardner's lack of conviction reduces everything to retro-fluff. Bond really isn't cut out for the work of tracking down serial killers, even the ones whose targets include Yasir Arafat and Kiri Te Kanawa. As Gardner struggles to update the perils his superstar hero faces, Bond himself remains the biggest anachronism of all. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

A torrent of portraits, posters, statues, films, plays, songs, and poems galvanized the Soviet population and inspired leftist activists around the world. In the first book to examine the cultural products and production methods of the Stalin cult, Jan Plamper reconstructs a hidden history linking artists, party patrons, state functionaries, and ultimately Stalin himself in the alchemical project that transformed a pock-marked Georgian into the embodiment of global communism. Departing from interpretations of the Stalin cult as an outgrowth of Russian mysticism or Stalin&#39;s psychopathology, Plamper establishes the cult&#39;s context within a broader international history of modern personality cults constructed around Napoleon III, Mussolini, Hitler, and Mao. Drawing upon evidence from previously inaccessible Russian archives, Plamper&#39;s lavishly illustrated and accessibly written study will appeal to anyone interested in twentieth-century history, visual studies, the politics of representation, dictator biography, socialist realism, and real socialism.</p><p><b>Jan Plamper</b> is Dilthey Fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin.<p>&#x201c;The crafting, production, and canonization of Stalin&#x2019;s image was no simple endeavor.

Lovejoy called "descriptive epistemology." Lovejoy's principal aim in this book is to clarify the distinction between the quite separate phenomena of the knower and the known, something regularly obvious to common sense, if not always to intellectual understanding. This work is as much an argument about the ineluctable differences between subject and object and between mentality and reality, as it is a subtle polemic against those who would stray far from acknowledging these differences. With a resolve that lasts over three hundred pages, Lovejoy offers candid evaluations of a generation's worth of philosophical discussions that address the problem of epistemological dualism.</p> <p>In his stunning new introduction, Jonathan B. Imber offers a reassessment of Lovejoy's career as a thinker and as an active participant in the worldly affairs of academic life. He introduces to a new generation of readers some enduring principles of the vocation of the scholar to which Lovejoy not only subscribed but to which he also gave substance through his activities as an academic man. The opening statement provides both a fit tribute to a great pioneer in the history of ideas, and an example of intellectual history in its own right. <em>The Revolt Against Dualism </em>will be a significant addition to the libraries of philosophers, sociologists, and history of ideas scholars.</p></p><p><p> <em>Arthur O. Lovejoy </em>(1873-1962) was professor of philosophy at John Hopkins University where he founded the History of Ideas Club. He believed that the history of ideas should focus on singular concepts. He founded the <em>Journal of the History of Ideas. </em>Some of his most famous writings include <em>Reflections on Human Nature, The Revolt against Dualism, </em>and <em>Primitivism and Related Ideas in Antiquity.</em></p></p><h2>Saunders Medical Assisting Exam Review (Saunders Medical Assisting Examination Review)</h2><p><p>With updated review questions and practice tests, <b>Saunders Medical Assisting Exam Review, 4th Edition</b> helps you prepare for and pass the CMA, RMA, CMAS, CCMA, and CMAA certification exams.

His publications deal chiefly with Spanish morphology, lexicology, and etymology.It's no secret that the Latinization of America is proceeding at a quick pace, so it follows that one of the more important reference books for the new century would be a Spanish-English dictionary. The University of Chicago Press has a history of publishing foreign-language textbooks dating back to the 1920s, and their Spanish-English dictionary has always been well regarded. Lacking the European air of a Larousse or a Langenscheidt, this new edition (the first in 15 years) stresses the malleability of both the American version of English and the Latin American version of Spanish. Besides the obligatory concise descriptions of grammar and verb conjugation, this edition includes new "context cues," which distinguish layers of meaning. For example, "soft" can be used to describe both butter and skin in English, whereas in Spanish, soft butter is blando, and soft skin is suave. Editor Pharies, a professor of Spanish at the University of Florida, also includes an array of jargon for the high-tech world (e.g., en linea for "online"), proving that Latin America is not yet succumbing to vulgar Spanglishisms. While the task of cataloguing regionalisms across Latin America is daunting, this dictionary does capture much of its slang, and even sometimes off-color usage, making the book as warm as its easygoing typeface.<br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Discovering Our Past: A History of the United States-Early Years, Reading Essentials and Study Guide, Student Workbook (THE AMERICAN JOURNEY TO 1877)</h2><p>Reinforce critical concepts from the text and help students improve their reading-for-information skills with this essential resource, written 2-3 grade levels below the Student Edition</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>The WorldatWork Handbook of Compensation, Benefits and Total Rewards: A Comprehensive Guide for HR Professionals</h2><p><b>Praise for <i>The WorldatWork Handbook of Compensation, Benefits &amp; Total Rewards</i></b> <p>This is the definitive guide to compensation and benefits for modern HR professionals who must attract, motivate, and retain quality employees.

It continues to be so now, when there are two widely held views. According to the first view, demons are everywhere.

Both these views are mistaken.

P. Hartley <br><br> "It is really a detective story in which the clues, instead of being actual, are psychological. The reader is made to feel all the tension and curiosity which a good crime novel inspires, and he is not disappointed." - <i>The Tablet</i> <br><br> Twelve years ago Claude Carlice was found dead of a gunshot wound. The verdict was suicide brought on by a fit of insanity, but his sister Isabel has never believed it. Now the day approaches when Claude's son Ronnie will come of age and take possession of Carlice Abbey. Preparations for the birthday party are underway, but it will not be a festive occasion: Ronnie, who has imbibed Marxist ideas at Oxford, intends to throw his aunt and stepmother out of the house and sign the entire estate over to the Communist Party for use as a propaganda centre. As tensions rise and the big day arrives, a strange series of events will unfold, revealing the scandalous truth behind Claude's death and resulting in an unexpected fate for Carlice Abbey and its occupants. <br><br> C.H.B. Kitchin (1895-1967) was both a best-selling crime writer and a critically acclaimed author of literary fiction. In <i>Birthday Party</i> (1938), he combined the two, resulting in a novel that is both a fascinating examination of a changing English society on the eve of the Second World War and a suspenseful psychological mystery full of unexpected twists and turns.

The proper functioning of these elements requires not only the mechanical harmony of the craniosacral system, but relies also on the exchange of information organized around proprioceptors, baroreceptors and chemoreceptors. These receptors are extremely sensitive. It is the nervous system -cranial nerves and the autonomic nervous system - which transports this intelligence. Neural dysfunctions have, therefore the ability to disturb the fundamental components of the primary respiratory mechanism.

Where did they come from? What is the connection between an ancient Jewish priest in Jerusalem and today&#x2019;s Israeli sunbather on the beaches of Tel Aviv? These questions stand at the heart of this engaging book. Geneticist David Goldstein analyzes modern DNA studies of Jewish populations and examines the intersections of these scientific findings with the history (both biblical and modern) and oral tradition of the Jews. With a special gift for translating complex scientific concepts into language understandable to all, Goldstein delivers an accessible, personal, and fascinating book that tells the history of a group of people through the lens of genetics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In a series of detective-style stories, Goldstein explores the priestly lineage of Jewish males as manifested by Y chromosomes; the Jewish lineage claims of the Lemba, an obscure black South African tribe; the differences in maternal and paternal genetic heritage among Jewish populations; and much more. The author also grapples with the medical and ethical implications of our rapidly growing command of the human genomic landscape. The study of genetics has not only changed the study of Jewish history, Goldstein shows, it has altered notions of Jewish identity and even our understanding of what makes a people a people.</p></p><p><p>David B. Goldstein is professor of molecular genetics and director of the Institute for Genome Science and Policy&#x2019;s Center for Population Genomics and Pharmacogenetics, Duke University. He lives in Durham, NC.</p>"Even readers unfamiliar with science will have no difficulty understanding this excellent book. David Goldstein clearly explains how modern genetics integrates with multiple aspects of Jewish history and demography."&#x2014;Kenneth Kidd, Yale University<br> (Kenneth Kidd)<br><br>"Goldstein is one of a handful of people qualified to write a book such as this, and he succeeds very well in providing accounts both of scientific studies and of Jewish historical background."&#x2014;Stephen Schaffner, Program in Medical and Population Genetics, The Broad Institute<br> (Stephen Schaffner)<br><br>&#x201c;To complement the rich heritage of ancient Jewish text, Dr. Goldstein brings a new kind of ancient record&#x2014;the history contained in our DNA. From the patterns of DNA variation among populations, he gleans insight into the social history of the Jewish people. Dr. Goldstein is a superb scientist and a captivating storyteller. <i>Jacob&#x2019;s Legacy</i> is a gem.&#x201d;&#x2014;Eric Lander, Director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and one of the principal leaders of the Human Genome Project (Eric Lander)<br><br>"An inspiring example of a magnificent analysis, written for a&nbsp;&nbsp;general audience, showing how multidisciplinary research using information from history, genetics, anthropology and more can give precious light on a great ethnos, the Jews."&#x2014;Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, professor of Genetics&nbsp;emeritus active, Stanford Medical School (Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza)<br><br>"With a special gift for translating complex scientific concepts into language understandable to all, Goldstein delivers an accessible, personal, and fascinating book that tells the history of a group of people through the lens of genetics."&#x2014;<i>Duke Today</i> (<i>Duke Today</i> 2008-07-22)<br><br>"[An] important and illuminating book&#x2014;written with keen intelligence and deep love of its subject. . . .

It had fewer stations than NBC or CBS, few advertisers, and therefore little revenue with which to pay for new programming. In order just to stay on the air, the &#x201c;other network&#x201d; was forced to schedule dozens of low-budget quiz shows, interview programs, and documentary films (most obtained free from government and industry). Needless to say, this did not attract much of an audience to the network. In 1952 ABC tried an experiment. It assembled a package of several dozen low-budget 30-minute dramatic films, most of them made by MCA Films in Hollywood. Many of them had been seen on TV before, on ABC (Gruen Guild Theater), DuMont (Gruen Playhouse), and some even on NBC (Campbell Soundstage). These shopworn films were sprinkled liberally throughout the ABC schedule during the 1952&#x2013;1953 season, on multiple &#x201c;theater&#x201d; series. Each film ran up to half a dozen times on different nights and on different series. Not every film would turn up on every series, but if you watched ABC long enough you would frequently get the impression that you had &#x201c;seen that film before.&#x201d;<br><br>Most of the films were grade &#x201c;B&#x201d; productions, starring some Hollywood old-timers as well as lesser-known young actors and actresses (some of whom were to gain fame in later years). Among them were Buddy Ebsen, Raymond Burr, Cesar Romero, Ann Rutherford, Helen Parrish, Vincent Price, Anita Louise, Hans Conried, Cliff Arquette, Onslow Stevens, and many others. The scripts included mysteries (such as &#x201c;The Cavorting Statue&#x201d; with Cesar Romero), romantic tales (&#x201c;A Little Pig Cried&#x201d; with Frances Rafferty), and comedies.<br><br>Following is a list of the theater series among which the films rotated, mostly during 1952&#x2013;1953.

It was launched in 1977 as CBN, the Christian Broadcasting Network, and originally featured a heavy dose of religious programming. A vestige of that era remains on its schedule today in The 700 Club (q.v.), a Christian news and features magazine hosted by network founder Pat Robertson. Among CBN&#x2019;s drama series during the 1980s were Another Life (1981&#x2013;1984), a Christian soap opera; and The Campbells (1986&#x2013;1989), about a Scottish family in the Canadian wilderness in the 1830s. CBN&#x2019;s big production center in Virginia Beach, Virginia, said to be the largest facility in the world for the production of Christian TV programming, was dubbed the &#x201c;Video Vatican.&#x201d;<br><br>The network gradually broadened its focus, acquiring a wide range of broadcast reruns, especially westerns but also including cartoons, game shows, and dramas (The Waltons, Rescue 911). In 1989, CBN was renamed the Family Channel. Although it promoted itself as the home of &#x201c;positive-value, upbeat programming the whole family can enjoy,&#x201d; its schedule was hardly without violence, particularly in rerun westerns such as Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The Young Riders. However, it generally avoided the contemporary sex and violence that is so widespread on broadcast channels. Family also became one of the more prolific producers of original series programming on cable, most of it light action/adventure emphasizing relationships and individual courage. There were also some sitcoms. Among its earlier series were Bordertown, Rin Tin Tin K-9 Cop, and Zorro; later entries included Big Brother Jake, Maniac Mansion, Snowy River: The MacGregor Saga, Madeline, and That&#x2019;s My Dog.<br><br>In 1998, Pat Robertson sold the network to Rupert Murdoch&#x2019;s News Corporation, which operates the Fox Network and is known for precisely the kind of edgy (often sexy and violent) programming the Family Channel traditionally abhorred. Effective August 15, 1998, the name was changed to the Fox Family Channel, and there were major on-air changes&#x2014;though not, initially at least, toward the kind of raunchy programming critics feared. Daytime was given over to cartoons and other kids&#x2019; programming, while in the evening there were lightweight family shows including I Can&#x2019;t Believe You Said That (quiz), Show Me the Funny (videos), Life, Camera, Action! (more videos), Ohhh, Noooo! Mr. Bill Presents (English comedy sketches), and The New Addams Family (sitcom). There were also nightly movies, including some produced by the channel.<br><br>Later entries included Higher Ground, The Fearing Mind and the critically acclaimed State of Grace. None of these was terribly successful, and after only three years Fox sold the network to Disney/ABC, which in November 2001 renamed it the ABC Family Channel. It then began to air reruns of current ABC series such as Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Alias, According to Jim, Life with Bonnie, Less Than Perfect, Celebrity Mole and The Bachelor. It also produced some reality programs of its own, including The Last Resort (specials, 2002) and My Life Is a Sitcom (series, 2003).<br><br>The network first reached more than half of all U.S. television homes in June 1989, and its principal original evening series after that date (including those mentioned above) can be found in this book under their individual titles.<br><br>ABC FEATURE FILM, see Movies&#x2014;Prior to 1961<br><br>ABC IN CONCERT (Music)<br><br>FIRST TELECAST: June 7, 1991<br><br>LAST TELECAST: September 11, 1998<br><br>BROADCAST HISTORY:<br><br>Jun 1991&#x2013;Dec 1992, ABC Fri 12:00 midnight&#x2013; 1:00 a.m.<br><br>Jan 1993&#x2013;Jan 1997, ABC Fri 12:05&#x2013;12:35 a.m.<br><br>Jan 1997&#x2013;Sep 1998, ABC Fri 12:35&#x2013;1:05 a.m.<br><br>HOST:<br><br>Madison Michele (1996&#x2013;1998)<br><br>From 1973 to 1975, as part of its Wide World o...</p><h2>Quantum Electronics</h2><p>This Third Edition of the popular text, while retaining nearly all the material of the previous edition, incorporates material on important new developments in lasers and quantum electronics.

This remarkable age produced such luminaries as Socrates, Herodotus, Thucydides, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and the sophists, and set the stage for the education and early careers of Plato and Xenophon, among others. <i>The School of History</i> provides the fullest and most detailed intellectual and political history available of Athens during the late fifth century b.c.e., as it examines the background, the context, and the decisive events shaping this society in the throes of war. This expansive, readable narrative ultimately leads to a new understanding of Athenian democratic culture, showing why and how it yielded such extraordinary intellectual productivity.<br><br> As both a source and a subject, Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War is the central text around which the narrative and thematic issues of the book revolve.

(Places Books, 1)</h2><p><p><b>A timely and important search for architecture's missing women</b></p><p>For a century and a half, women have been proving their passion and talent for building and, in recent decades, their enrollment in architecture schools has soared. Yet the number of women working as architects remains stubbornly low, and the higher one looks in the profession, the scarcer women become. Law and medicine, two equally demanding and traditionally male professions, have been much more successful in retaining and integrating women. So why do women still struggle to keep a toehold in architecture? <i>Where Are the Women Architects?</i> tells the story of women's stagnating numbers in a profession that remains a male citadel, and explores how a new generation of activists is fighting back, grabbing headlines, and building coalitions that promise to bring about change.</p><p>Despina Stratigakos's provocative examination of the past, current, and potential future roles of women in the profession begins with the backstory, revealing how the field has dodged the question of women's absence since the nineteenth century. It then turns to the status of women in architecture today, and the serious, entrenched hurdles they face. But the story isn't without hope, and the book documents the rise of new advocates who are challenging the profession's boys' club, from its male-dominated elite prizes to the erasure of women architects from Wikipedia. These advocates include Stratigakos herself and here she also tells the story of her involvement in the controversial creation of Architect Barbie.</p><p>Accessible, frank, and lively, <i>Where Are the Women Architects?</i> will be a revelation for readers far beyond the world of architecture.</p></p><p><p>"This important and sharp critique makes a convincing argument about the status of women and the deep-seated gender issues in the profession of architecture.

Small business is not responsible for most of the country's job creation and innovation. American democracy does not depend on the existence of brave bands of self-employed citizens. Small businesses are not systematically discriminated against by government policy makers. Rather, Atkinson and Lind argue, small businesses are not the font of jobs, because most small businesses fail. The only kind of small firm that contributes to technological innovation is the technological start-up, and its success depends on scaling up. The idea that self-employed citizens are the foundation of democracy is a relic of Jeffersonian dreams of an agrarian society. And governments, motivated by a confused mix of populist and free market ideology, in fact go out of their way to promote small business. Every modern president has sung the praises of small business, and every modern president, according to Atkinson and Lind, has been wrong. </p><p>Pointing to the advantages of scale for job creation, productivity, innovation, and virtually all other economic benefits, Atkinson and Lind argue for a &#x201c;size neutral&#x201d; policy approach both in the United States and around the world that would encourage growth rather than enshrine an anachronism. If we overthrow the &#x201c;small is beautiful&#x201d; ideology, we will be able to recognize large firms as the engines of progress and prosperity that they are.</p></p><p><p> Robert Atkinson is Founder and President of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C. think tank, and coauthor of <em>Innovation Economics: The Race for Global Advantage</em>. </p> <p> Michael Lind is a Visiting Professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs of the University of Texas and author of <em>Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States</em>. </p><p>Atkinson and Lind's deeply researched book is a needed corrective to current unexamined assumptions about job creation. While acknowledging that the power of giants can bring abuses, they make a compelling case about the virtues of size and scale for innovation and national enrichment. Agree or not, their economic prescriptions are sure to be discussed widely by policy makers of all political persuasions.</p>&#x2015;<b>Rosabeth Moss Kanter</b>, Professor, Harvard Business School; author of <i>Move: Putting America's Infrastructure Back in the Lead</i><br><br><p>Atkinson and Lind present a well-researched and thoughtful correction to the widely held view that it is small business alone that is the engine of economic progress. Their focus on the importance of scale is both historically grounded and eminently relevant to today's connected and information-driven global economy. <i>Big Is Beautiful</i> should be read by business leaders and policy makers around the world.</p>&#x2015;<b>Sam Palmisano</b>, Chairman, The Center for Global Enterprise; former Chairman and CEO, IBM<br><br><p>Atkinson and Lind reconstruct the history of economic development to document the role of large enterprises in driving technological innovation and growth.

The twenty-eight essays collected here invite readers to reflect upon the ways the mind is structured around and through knowing, not-knowing, and sort-of-knowing or uncertainty. The authors explore the ramifications of being up against the limits of what they can know as through their clinical practice, and theoretical considerations, they simultaneously attempt to open up psychic and physical experience. How, they ask, do we tolerate ambiguity and blind spots as we try to know? And how do we make all of this useful to our patients and ourselves? The authors approach these and similar epistemological questions through an impressively wide variety of clinical dilemmas (e.g., the impact of new technologies upon the analytic dyad) and theoretical specialties (e.g., neurobiology).</p><p>Jean Petrucelli&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t miss this marvelous collection of articles, the record of one of the most scintillating psychoanalytic conferences I can ever remember attending. It&#x2019;s a real knockout&#x2015;brilliantly conceived and masterfully realized. Virtually everyone you might expect to be included in a project called Knowing, Not-Knowing, and Sort-of Knowing is included, and then some, and the result is a volume of breadth and depth that will be read for decades.&#x201d; (Donnel B. Stern, PhD)<br><br>&#x201c;What I know is that <i>Knowing, Not-Knowing, and Sort-of Knowing</i> is a book you should read. Jean Petrucelli has collected a large group of jewels and produced a psychoanalytic crown. This cutting-edge collection covers those topics you will most want to know about in today's psychoanalytic world, from dissociation, multiple self-states, neuro-psychoanalysis, affect theory, implicit knowing, and more. It is fitting that such a book ends with essays on joy, as it is a joy to have this collection available.&#x201d; (Lewis Aron, PhD)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a brave book and an important one. It is timely too. The interest in the ordinariness of dissociative states of mind and its place in all of our psyches, not just the traumatic, is allowing our field to question the historical grip that psychoanalysis has had on the need to know, the need to be right, the need to offer the correct interpretation. In short, the need to find certainty. Psychoanalysis is now such a developing praxis that we can come to humility without fear. We can afford to address questions of &#x2018;knowing&#x2019; and &#x2018;not-knowing', and even &#x2018;maybe knowing&#x2019;, without the edifice crumbling. Indeed, as this important collection of papers shows, it is in the questioning that our understandings and approaches to the mind develop and strengthen. As we open ourselves up to uncertainties, we have the means to offer the mixture of uncertainty and rigor; of knowing and not-knowing; of thinking and rethinking, to the people we see, thus enlivening them, ourselves, and our theories.&#x201d; (Susie Orbach, psychoanalyst and author of Bodies; Co-Founder)</p><h2>Orchids (Little Plant Library)</h2><p>The introduction describes how orchids grow in the wild, their history, and details orchid botany and nomenclature.</p><p>This small, tidy, colorful book tells you what you need to know to grow orchids successfully.

He is&nbsp;the science correspondent for CBS's <i>This Morning</i> and host of the radio programs <i>Science Fantastic</i> and <i>Explorations in Science</i>.Houdini believed that telepathy was impossible. But science is proving<br>Houdini wrong.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Telepathy is now the subject of intense research at universities around<br>the world, where scientists have already been able to use advanced sensors to<br>read individual words, images, and thoughts in a person&#x2019;s brain. This could<br>alter the way we communicate with stroke and accident victims who are<br>&#x201c;locked in&#x201d; their bodies, unable to articulate their thoughts except through<br>blinks. But that&#x2019;s just the start. Telepathy might also radically change the way<br>we interact with computers and the outside world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, in a recent &#x201c;Next 5 in 5 Forecast,&#x201d; which predicts five revolutionary<br>developments in the next five years, IBM scientists claimed that we will<br>be able to mentally communicate with computers, perhaps replacing the<br>mouse and voice commands. This means using the power of the mind to call<br>people on the phone, pay credit card bills, drive cars, make appointments,<br>create beautiful symphonies and works of art, etc. The possibilities are endless,<br>and it seems that everyone&#x2014; from computer giants, educators, video<br>game companies, and music studios to the Pentagon&#x2014; is converging on this<br>technology.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True telepathy, found in science-fiction and fantasy novels, is not possible<br>without outside assistance. As we know, the brain is electrical. In general,<br>anytime an electron is accelerated, it gives off electromagnetic radiation. The<br>same holds true for electrons oscillating inside the brain, which broadcasts<br>radio waves. But these signals are too faint to be detected by others, and<br>even if we could perceive these radio waves, it would be difficult to make<br>sense of them. Evolution has not given us the ability to decipher this collection<br>of random radio signals, but computers can. Scientists have been able<br>to get crude approximations of a person&#x2019;s thoughts using EEG scans. Subjects<br>would put on a helmet with EEG sensors and concentrate on certain<br>pictures&#x2014; say, the image of a car. The EEG signals were then recorded for<br>each image and eventually a rudimentary dictionary of thought was created,<br>with a one- to- one correspondence between a person&#x2019;s thoughts and the EEG<br>image. Then, when a person was shown a picture of another car, the computer<br>would recognize the EEG pattern as being from a car.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of EEG sensors is that they are noninvasive and quick.<br>You simply put a helmet containing many electrodes onto the surface of the<br>brain and the EEG can rapidly identify signals that change every millisecond.<br>But the problem with EEG sensors, as we have seen, is that electromagnetic<br>waves deteriorate as they pass through the skull, and it is difficult to locate<br>their precise source. This method can tell if you are thinking of a car or a<br>house, but it cannot re- create an image of the car. That is where Dr. Jack Gallant&#x2019;s<br>work comes in.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>VIDEOS OF THE MIND</b><br><br>The epicenter for much of this research is the University of California at<br>Berkeley, where I received my own Ph.D. in theoretical physics years ago. I<br>had the pleasure of touring the laboratory of Dr. Gallant, whose group has<br>accomplished a feat once considered to be impossible: videotaping people&#x2019;s<br>thoughts. &#x201c;This is a major leap forward reconstructing internal imagery. We<br>are opening a window into the movies in our mind,&#x201d; says Gallant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I visited his laboratory, the first thing I noticed was the team of<br>young, eager postdoctoral and graduate students huddled in front of their<br>computer screens, looking intently at video images that were reconstructed<br>from someone&#x2019;s brain scan. Talking to Gallant&#x2019;s team, you feel as though you<br>are witnessing scientific history in the making.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant explained to me that first the subject lies flat on a stretcher, which<br>is slowly inserted headfirst into a huge, state- of- the- art MRI machine, costing<br>upward of $3 million. The subject is then shown several movie clips (such<br>as movie trailers readily available on YouTube). To accumulate enough data,<br>the subject has to sit motionless for hours watching these clips, a truly arduous<br>task. I asked one of the postdocs, Dr. Shinji Nishimoto, how they found<br>volunteers who were willing to lie still for hours on end with only fragments<br>of video footage to occupy the time. He said the people in the room, the grad<br>students and postdocs, volunteered to be guinea pigs for their own research.<br>As the subject watches the movies, the MRI machine creates a 3- D image<br>of the blood flow within the brain. The MRI image looks like a vast collection<br>of thirty thousand dots, or voxels. Each voxel represents a pinpoint of neural energy, and the color of the dot corresponds to the intensity of the signal and blood flow. Red dots represent points of large neural activity, while blue dots represent points of less activity. (The final image looks very much like thousands of Christmas lights in the shape of the brain. Immediately you can see that the brain is concentrating most of its mental energy in the visual cortex, which is located at the back of the brain, while watching these videos.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallant&#x2019;s MRI machine is so powerful it can identify two to three hundred distinct regions of the brain and, on average, can take snapshots that have one hundred dots per region of the brain. (One goal for future generations of MRI technology is to provide an even sharper resolution by increasing the number of dots per region of the brain.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, this 3- D collection of colored dots looks like gibberish. But after<br>years of research, Dr. Gallant and his colleagues have developed a mathematical<br>formula that begins to find relationships between certain features of a picture (edges, textures, intensity, etc.) and the MRI voxels. For example, if you look at a boundary, you&#x2019;ll notice it&#x2019;s a region separating lighter and darker areas, and hence the edge generates a certain pattern of voxels. By having subject after subject view such a large library of movie clips, this mathematical formula is refined, allowing the computer to analyze how all sorts of images are converted into MRI voxels. Eventually the scientists were able to ascertain a direct correlation between certain MRI patterns of voxels<br>and features within each picture.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, the subject is then shown another movie trailer. The computer<br>analyzes the voxels generated during this viewing and re- creates a rough approximation of the original image. (The computer selects images from one hundred movie clips that most closely resemble the one that the subject just saw and then merges images to create a close approximation.) In this way, the computer is able to create a fuzzy video of the visual imagery going through your mind. Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s mathematical formula is so versatile that it can take a collection of MRI voxels and convert it into a picture, or it can do the reverse, taking a picture and then converting it to MRI voxels.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a chance to view the video created by Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s group, and it was<br>very impressive. Watching it was like viewing a movie with faces, animals,<br>street scenes, and buildings through dark glasses. Although you could not<br>see the details within each face or animal, you could clearly identify the kind<br>of object you were seeing.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only can this program decode what you are looking at, it can also<br>decode imaginary images circulating in your head. Let&#x2019;s say you are asked to<br>think of the <i>Mona Lisa. </i>We know from MRI scans that even though you&#x2019;re<br>not viewing the painting with your eyes, the visual cortex of your brain will<br>light up. Dr. Gallant&#x2019;s program then scans your brain while you are thinking<br>of the <i>Mona Lisa </i>and flips through its data files of pictures, trying to find the<br>closest match. In one experiment I saw, the computer selected a picture of<br>the actress Salma Hayek as the closest approximation to the <i>Mona Lisa. </i>Of<br>course, the average person can easily recognize hundreds of faces, but the<br>fact that the computer analyzed an image within a person&#x2019;s brain and then<br>picked out this picture from millions of random pictures at its disposal is<br>still impressive.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this whole process is to create an accurate dictionary that<br>allows you to rapidly match an object in the real world with the MRI pattern<br>in your brain. In general, a detailed match is very difficult and will take years,<br>but some categories are actually easy to read just by flipping through some<br>photographs. Dr. Stanislas Dehaene of the Coll�ge de France in Paris was<br>examining MRI scans of the parietal lobe, where numbers are recognized,<br>when one of his postdocs casually mentioned that just by quickly scanning<br>the MRI pattern, he could tell what number the subject was looking at. In<br>fact, certain numbers created distinctive patterns on the MRI scan. He notes,<br>&#x201c;If you take 200 voxels in this area, and look at which of them are active<br>and which are inactive, you can construct a machine-learning device that<br>decodes which number is being held in memory.&#x201d;<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This leaves open the question of when we might be able to have picture quality<br>videos of our thoughts. Unfortunately, information is lost when a<br>person is visualizing an image. Brain scans corroborate this. When you compare<br>the MRI scan of the brain as it is looking at a flower to an MRI scan<br>as the brain is thinking about a flower, you immediately see that the second<br>image has far fewer dots than the first. So although this technology will<br>vastly improve in the coming years, it will never be perfect. (I once read a<br>short story in which a man meets a genie who offers to create anything that<br>the person can imagine. The man immediately asks for a luxury car, a jet<br>plane, and a million dollars. At first, the man is ecstatic. But when he looks at<br>these items in detail, he sees that the car and the plane have no engines, and<br>the image on the cash is all blurred. Everything is useless. This is because our<br>memories are only approximations of the real thing.)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But given the rapidity with which scientists are beginning to decode the<br>MRI patterns in the brain, will we soon be able to actually read words and<br>thoughts circulating in the mind?<br><b><br>READING THE MIND</b><br><br>In fact, in a building next to Gallant&#x2019;s laboratory, Dr. Brian Pasley and his<br>colleagues are literally reading thoughts&#x2014; at least in principle. One of the<br>postdocs there, Dr. Sara Szczepanski, explained to me how they are able to<br>identify words inside the mind.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists used what is called ECOG (electrocorticogram) technology,<br>which is a vast improvement over the jumble of signals that EEG scans<br>produce. ECOG scans are unprecedented in accuracy and resolution, since<br>signals are directly recorded from the brain and do not pass through the<br>skull. The flipside is that one has to remove a portion of the skull to place a<br>mesh, containing sixty-four electrodes in an eight-by-eight grid, directly on<br>top of the exposed brain.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily they were able to get permission to conduct experiments with<br>ECOG scans on epileptic patients, who were suffering from debilitating seizures.<br>The ECOG mesh was placed on the patients&#x2019; brains while open- brain<br>surgery was being performed by doctors at the nearby University of California<br>at San Francisco.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the patients hear various words, signals from their brains pass through<br>the electrodes and are then recorded. Eventually a dictionary is formed,<br>matching the word with the signals emanating from the electrodes in the<br>brain. Later, when a word is uttered, one can see the same electrical pattern. This correspondence also means that if one is thinking of a certain word, the<br>computer can pick up the characteristic signals and identify it.<br>With this technology, it might be possible to have a conversation that<br>takes place entirely telepathically. Also, stroke victims who are totally paralyzed<br>may be able to &#x201c;talk&#x201d; through a voice synthesizer that recognizes the<br>brain patterns of individual words.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not surprisingly, BMI (brain- machine interface) has become a hot field,<br>with groups around the country making significant breakthroughs. Similar<br>results were obtained by scientists at the University of Utah in 2011. They<br>placed grids, each containing sixteen electrodes, over the facial motor cortex<br>(which controls movements of the mouth, lips, tongue, and face) and<br>Wernicke&#x2019;s area, which processes information about language. The person was then asked to say ten common words, such as &#x201c;yes&#x201d; and &#x201c;no,&#x201d; &#x201c;hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;cold,&#x201d; &#x201c;hungry&#x201d; and &#x201c;thirsty,&#x201d; &#x201c;hello&#x201d; and &#x201c;good- bye,&#x201d; and &#x201c;more&#x201d; and &#x201c;less.&#x201d; Using a computer to record the brain signals when these words were uttered, the scientists were able to create a rough one- to- one correspondence between spoken words and computer signals from the brain.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, when the patient voiced certain words, they were able to correctly<br>identify each one with an accuracy ranging from 76 percent to 90 percent.<br>The next step is to use grids with 121 electrodes to get better resolution.<br>In the future, this procedure may prove useful for individuals suffering<br>from strokes or paralyzing illnesses such as Lou Gehrig&#x2019;s disease, who would<br>be able to speak using the brain- to- computer technique.<br><b><br>TYPING WITH THE MIND</b><br><br>At the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Dr. Jerry Shih has hooked up epileptic<br>patients via ECOG sensors so they can learn how to type with the mind.<br>The calibration of this device is simple. The patient is first shown a series<br>of letters and is told to focus mentally on each symbol. A computer records<br>the signals emanating from the brain as it scans each letter. As with the other<br>experiments, once this one- to- one dictionary is created, it is then a simple<br>matter for the person to merely think of the letter and for the letter to be<br>typed on a screen, using only the power of the mind.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Shih, the leader of this project, says that the accuracy of his machine<br>is nearly 100 percent. Dr. Shih believes that he can next create a machine to<br>record images, not just words, that patients conceive in their minds. This<br>could have applications for artists and architects, but the big drawback of<br>ECOG technology, as we have mentioned, is that it requires opening up<br>patients&#x2019; brains.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, EEG typewriters, because they are noninvasive, are entering<br>the marketplace. They are not as accurate or precise as ECOG typewriters,<br>but they have the advantage that they can be sold over the counter. Guger<br>Technologies, based in Austria, recently demonstrated an EEG typewriter at<br>a trade show. According to their officials, it takes only ten minutes or so for<br>people to learn how to use this machine, and they can then type at the rate<br>of five to ten words per minute.</p><h2>Pilot&#39;s Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge</h2><p><i>Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge</i>, created by the Federal Aviation Administration, is the official reference manual for pilots at all levels.

While today he is overshadowed by his more famous cousin Vladimir, Nicolas Nabokov was during his lifetime an outstanding and far-sighted player in international cultural exchanges during the Cold War and admired by some of the most distinguished minds of his century for his political acumen and his talents as a composer. <br><br>This first-ever biography of Nabokov follows the fascinating stages of his life: a privileged childhood before the Revolution; the beginnings of a promising musical career launched under the aegis of Diaghilev; his involvement in anti-Stalinist causes in the first years of the Cold War; his participation in the Congress for Cultural Freedom; his role as cultural advisor to the Mayor of Berlin and director of the Berlin Festival in the early 1960s; his American academic and musical career in the late 1960s and 1970s. Nabokov is unique not only in that he was involved on a high level in international cultural politics, but also in that his life intersected at all times with a vast array of people within - and also well beyond - the confines of classical music. <br><br>Drawing on a vast array of primary sources, Vincent Giroud's biography opens a window into history for readers interested in twentieth-century music, Russian emigration, and the Cold War, particularly in its cultural aspects. Musicians and musicologists interested in Nabokov as a composer, or in twentieth century Russian composers in general, will find in this book information not available anywhere else.<br></p><p><br>Born in France and educated at Oxford, <strong>Vincent Giroud</strong> is a cultural historian who has taught in French, British, and American institutions. He served for many years as curator of modern books and manuscripts at Yale and is currently Professor of English and Comparative Literature at The University of Franche-Comt�.<br><br>"Conductor, author, translator, multi-lingual cosmopolite, Nicolas Nabokov was one of the most versatile intellectuals of the past century. Vincent Giroud, a brilliant musicologist and Nabokov's very first biographer, narrates his subject's multi-faceted life with unusual clarity and vigor." -- Francine du Plessix Gray<p></p><br>"They just don't make cultured, quadrilingual, cosmopolitans of this sort anymore. Nicolas Nabokov managed to hit every artistic and intellectual high note of the 20th century, missing no one, from Auden and Balanchine to Virgil Thomson and Edmund Wilson. The genius went equally into the life and the music; Vincent Giroud elegantly captures both in his joyous, star-studded, beautifully modulated biography." - Stacy Schiff, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>V�ra: (Mrs. Vladimir Nabokov)</em><p></p><br>"Nicolas Nabokov is our most famous unknown composer.

This is a very popular notion, and is often repeated by scholars from all camps in Judaism. Yet such a position ignores the long history of Jewish theology in which Maimonides&#39; principles have been subject to great dispute. Now available in paperback, this book begins with a discussion of the significance of the principles and illustrates how they assumed such a central place in traditional Judaism. Each of the principles is then considered in turn - the reasons underlying Maimonides&#39; formulation are expounded and the disputes that have arisen concerning them are discussed in detail. The authoritative analysis makes it quite clear that the notion that Maimonides&#39; principles are the last word in traditional Jewish theology is a misconception, and that even Maimonides himself was not fully convinced of every aspect of his formulation. Although structured around Maimonides&#39; principles, the book can also be seen as an encyclopedia of traditional Jewish thought concerning the central issues of Jewish theology. The diversity of opinion in Jewish tradition on such issues as God, Creation, and the Revelation of the Torah are sure to surprise readers. 2004 National Jewish Book Award Finalist.</p><p>Marc B. Shapiro holds the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Chair in Judaic Studies at the University of Scranton, Pennsylvania. A graduate of Brandeis and Harvard universities, he is the author of Between the Yeshiva World and Modern Orthodoxy: The Life and Works of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg,<br>1884-1966 (1999), also published by the Littman Library, and is editing the collected writings of Rabbi Jehiel Jacob Weinberg, the first volume of which appeared in 1998, and the second in 2003.&#39;Inspiring and breath-taking ... highly recommended.&#39; - Yisrael Dubitsky, Association of Jewish Libraries Newsletter &#39;Marc Shapiro puts an explicit contemporary context on this remarkable collection of sources that disagreed with one part or other of Maimonides&#39; Thirteen Principles ... By showing the extent to which past authors disagreed with those Principles, Shapiro seeks to debunk assertions by contemporary writers that place those Principles at the core of Orthodox belief ... the work is astonishing in its rage. Shapiro uses his daunting biographical abilities and his considerable skill as a writer to present his material-well-known and obscure-cogently and entertainingly. To the reader interested in the limits of the theological imagination of Jews, it is not likely to be soon rivalled.&#39; - Gidon Rothstein, AJS Review &#39;A courageous and meticulously research book that straddles two worlds-that of abstract scholarship and of practical religious vision ... The real tour de force of the book is the enormous amount of material he musters to make his case.&#39; - Bradley Shavit Artson, Conservative Judaism &#39;Combines remarkable erudition with clarity of vision.&#39; - Menachem Kellner, Edah Journal &#39;His research is exhaustive, almost encyclopedic, and it is highly convincing ... his aim is truly constructive and his tone is passionately concerned.&#39; - Erin Leib, Jerusalem Report &#39;This exhaustive yet readable study ... is astonishingly well researched ... a polemical work of considerable erudition, which will find a broad audience.&#39; - Harvey Belovski, Jewish Chronicle &#39;Ground-breaking ... As Shapiro so clearly demonstrates in this landmark work, the need is not only for theological discussions, but for theology.&#39; - Miriam Shaviv, Jewish Quarterly &#39;Shapiro&#39;s book is doubly remarkable: it is at the same time a commentary on Maimonides&#39; Thirteen Principles, and a successful summary of the central themes of Jewish theology, offering deep insight into what the blurb calls traditional Jewish thought&#34;.&#39; - Stefan Schreiner, Judaica &#39;Articulate and thought-provoking ... This book is no less important on social than on scholarly grounds. Shapiro presents his stance with great passion, giving readers the sense that he is involved in a truth spreading mission. His passion appears to me justified and legitimate, since abstract theology is indeed an essential element in the shaping of current Orthodox society, particularly in Israel but also outside it. In sum: this book provides scholars with a justification for a view that most of them had already sensed and accepted and opens up to a broader intellectual public a path to understanding Jewish philosophy.&#39; - Dov Schwartz, Review of Rabbinic Judaism</p><h2>A Dictionary of Japanese Particles (A Kodansha Dictionary) (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>For English-speaking students of Japanese, particles are perhaps the most difficult aspect of the language to learn.

A narrative presents itself, a tour of indices and trends, perhaps a memoir? None, however, will suffice, because in forty years more has changed than those two towns--the anthropologist, for instance, anthropology itself, even the intellectual and moral world in which the discipline exists. And so, in looking back on four decades of anthropology in the field, Geertz has created a work that is characteristically unclassifiable, a personal history that is also a retrospective reflection on developments in the human sciences amid political, social, and cultural changes in the world. An elegant summation of one of the most remarkable careers in anthropology, it is at the same time an eloquent statement of the purposes and possibilities of anthropology's interpretive powers.</p><p>To view his two towns in time, Pare in Indonesia and Sefrou in Morocco, Geertz adopts various perspectives on anthropological research and analysis during the post-colonial period, the Cold War, and the emergence of the new states of Asia and Africa. Throughout, he clarifies his own position on a broad series of issues at once empirical, methodological, theoretical, and personal. The result is a truly original book, one that displays a particular way of practicing the human sciences and thus a particular--and particularly efficacious--view of what these sciences are, have been, and should become.</p></p><p>Clifford Geertz is Harold F. Linder Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.'It is difficult to know what to do with the past,' Geertz writes, but of his own past he has made an elegant, almost meditative volume of reflections. In prose that is sometimes liquid, sometimes faux-Jamesian, Geertz looks back over the sites of his anthropological labors: Sefrou, in Morocco; Pare, in Indonesia; the University of Chicago; the Institute for Advanced Study, at Princeton...The reader is allowed to witness how fruitfully accident and idea have mingled in the making of one anthropologist's career. (<i>New Yorker</i>)<br><br>This long-awaited professional memoir by...one of anthropology's most illustrious demigods plays on the ambiguity of method in a curious discipline that began in the early twentieth century as something of a treasure hunt after lives and cultures in exotic, faraway places...Worked in between Geertz's ethnographic tales, anecdotes, and reminiscences of fieldwork in Sefrou and Pare is the engrossing story of a few key moments in American social science during the second half of the twentieth century as he participated in them. (Nancy Scheper-Hughes <i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br><i>After the Fact</i> is a retrospective on a remarkable career, and on the worlds that shaped its characteristic contours. (Benedict Anderson <i>London Review of Books</i>)<br><br>This memoir by the eminent cultural anthropologist functions at several levels. It is worth reading just for the well-chosen and narrated anecdotes from Geertz's fieldwork in Indonesia and Morocco. This book is also an anthropological critique of the extensive political-economic changes in the Third World over the past 40 years. On a more philosophical level, Geertz has written a series of meditative reflections on the nature of anthropological knowledge...Geertz shows the value of building patterns and connections from multiple, nuanced, first-hand observations of an anthropologist. (Adan Quan <i>Antioch Review</i>)<br><br>Geertz's disarmingly casual [book is]...a history of his relationships with the towns in Indonesia and Morocco where he's done his most sustained fieldwork, cast in terms of a history of the ideas that have shaped that work...Its deftly rendered anecdotes always serve as illustrations of concepts...Elegant. (Michael Gorra <i>Transition</i>)<br><br>A new book by Clifford Geertz is an event...[The] chapters on Java and Morocco...are marked by the impressive learning, the illuminating insights, the marvelous description of scene and event, the masterful summary of complex social history, and the evocative characterization of cultural heritage, as well as the elegant style, the pithy phrase, and the illuminating trope, that we have come to expect from vintage Geertz...In sum, an intellectual feast. (Melford E. Spiro <i>Society</i>)<br><br><i>After the Fact</i> is Clifford Geertz's Jerusalem-Harvard lectures, jointly sponsored by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Harvard University. Appropriate to its venue, the books addresses major questions, making strong theoretical and empirical claims. For that reason, <i>After the Fact</i> is a rather touching confession, even a testament. (Paul Rabinow <i>American Anthropologist</i>)<br><br>An unabashedly honest ethnography that faces head-on the challenge of representing the 'other' in the social sciences' 'post-postmodernist' climate of uncertainty. As a founder of 'symbolic' anthropology...Geertz has already made an impressive contribution to the field. This book--a series of reflections on his fieldwork over a period of some 40 years in two locations: Pare, Indonesia, and Sefrou, Morocco--vibrantly demonstrates that ethnography can still be a viable and worthwhile enterprise...Brilliant.

Little is known of the author of this treatise Ab&#x16b; Bakr al-Kal&#x101;b&#x101;dh&#x12b;, except that he was a lawyer and died in Bukh&#x101;r&#x101; in about AD 990. This book is the work on which his fame rests, and is important because it is the earliest extant text to reconcile the position of S&#x16b;f&#x12b;sm and orthodox Islam. The book consists of five parts: a general introduction to the term S&#x16b;f&#x12b; and an enumeration of the names of the great S&#x16b;f&#x12b;s; a statements of the tenets of Islam, as accepted by the S&#x16b;f&#x12b;s; a discussion of the various 'stations' of the S&#x16b;f&#x12b;s; and a discussion of the various phenomena of S&#x16b;f&#x12b;sm.

This superb short introduction to Martin Luther, written by a leading authority on Luther and the Reformation, presents this pivotal figure as historians now see him. Instead of singling him out as a modern hero, historian Scott Hendrix emphasizes the context in which Luther worked, the colleagues who supported him, and the opponents who adamantly opposed his agenda for change. The author explains the religious reformation and Luther's importance without ignoring the political and cultural forces, like princely power and Islam, which led the reformation down paths Luther could neither foresee nor influence. The book pays tribute to Luther's genius but also recognizes the self-righteous attitude that alienated contemporaries. The author offers a unique explanation for that attitude and for Luther's anti-Jewish writings, which are especially hard to comprehend after the Holocaust.<br></p><p><br><strong>Scott H. Hendrix</strong> is Professor Emeritus of Reformation History at Princeton Theological Seminary. He is a past president of the Society for Reformation Research.<br>This is a great addition to OUP&#39;s &#39;Very Short Introductions&#39; series of books, which manages to pack a huge amount of fascinating and useful material into just over a hundred small pages. ... The author is clearly aware of a vast amount of scholarly discussion and secondary literature on Luther and has an enviable ability to summarise and critique it in short compass, and he does a good job of helping us appreciate the historical distance between us and Luther. * Lee Gatiss, Churchman * A useful new book. * Scott Hendrix, The Daily Telegraph *</p><h2>The Sign of Four (1892 Illustrated Edition): 100th Anniversary Collection</h2><p><b>A nice edition with the first edition cover and 13 original illustrations.</b><p><i>The Sign of Four</i> was first released to magazines in 1890.

It helps with focus and is fun. It engages the right brain by getting into the flow of color, form, and movement. It offers the opportunity for personal creativity, using stunning, colorful forms to stimulate originality. Creative form drawing can be energizing and relaxing, calming and enlivening, and a valuable aid to harmonizing body and soul.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This first creative form drawing book for adults features fourfold patterns of increasing challenge, featuring Celtic, Moorish, Native American, and Buddhist patterns and encourages the development of new forms. The forms have symmetry&#x2015;balance between left and right and between above and below, connecting the center with the periphery while providing stability and harmony.</p> <p>Some forms are rhythmic, with patterns that move in flowing rhythms and lines. Other forms are inspired organically by nature&#x2019;s colors and formations. Flowers provide inspiring ideas for color combinations and new forms. Drawing with line, form, color, and beauty is a balancing, healing, and enlivening process.</p> <p>Originally developed by Rudolf Steiner, creative form drawing is widely used in Waldorf education to support healthy development and learning of children of all ages, aiding eye&#x2013;hand coordination, balance, confident movement, observation, and drawing skills.&nbsp;</p></p><p>Angela Lord is a painter, interior colour designer, muralist and art therapist.

This handsome book presents for the first time the wide range of his equine imagery, from refined portraits of racehorses to violent scenes of horses attacked by lions in the wild.</p><p>Taking full account of the associations and status of the noble horse&#x201d; in eighteenth-century Britain and the colorful world of its devotees both high and low the authors examine Stubbs&#x2019;s work from different points of view and offer many fresh interpretations. Malcolm Warner discusses how horses were regarded in Britain in Stubbs&#x2019;s time, the unexpected connection between his horse-and-lion compositions and the creation of the English thoroughbred, and his classicism. Robin Blake examines the young Whig noblemen who were Stubbs&#x2019;s first patrons, the grooms, jockeys, trainers, and other attendants who appear in his horse portraits, and his curious dealings with the Prince of Wales. The book also includes an essay by conservators Lance Mayer and Gay Myers on Stubbs&#x2019;s experiments with wax and enamel.</p><p>For admirers of Stubbs&#x2019;s art, eighteenth-century English painting, and horses, this book is an essential addition to their bookshelves.</p></p><p><p><b>Malcolm Warner</b>, Senior Curator at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas, is the author of several books, including <i>The Victorians: British Painting, 1837-1901 </i>and<i> Millais: Portraits; </i><b>Robin Blake</b> is an independent scholar based in London and is the author of a forthcoming biography on Stubbs; Lance Mayer and Gay Myers are consulting conservators based at the Lyman Allyn Art Museum in New London, Connecticut.</p><br>Some art history scholars regard George Stubbs as possibly the best painter of horses ever. The 200 images in this volume, the catalog to a current exhibition (now in Fort Worth; in Baltimore to mid-2005) of Stubbs' oeuvre, demonstrate the strength of the assertion. Stubbs flourished from the 1760s to the 1790s primarily on commissions from British landed aristocrats. As Warner and Blake note in their essays, Stubbs gained the nobility's attention with an extraordinary calling card: a set of anatomical drawings that Stubbs based on intense study of equine cadavers. Horses appear strikingly lifelike in his paintings, which, besides their representational quality, embody the beginning of a more humane attitude toward animals. The authors praise Stubbs' individuation of horses, which markedly distinguishes him from painters for whom horses functioned as background scenery or pedestals for generals, not worthwhile subjects in themselves. A worthy tribute to Stubbs' beautifully vibrant work. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield-weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertion-this gripping, semi-autobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep.</p><p>As a youth of 18, Ernest Hemingway was eager to fight in the Great War. Poor vision kept him out of the army, so he joined the ambulance corps instead and was sent to France. Then he transferred to Italy where he became the first American wounded in that country during World War I. Hemingway came out of the European battlefields with a medal for valor and a wealth of experience that he would, 10 years later, spin into literary gold with <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>. This is the story of Lieutenant Henry, an American, and Catherine Barkley, a British nurse. The two meet in Italy, and almost immediately Hemingway sets up the central tension of the novel: the tenuous nature of love in a time of war. During their first encounter, Catherine tells Henry about her fianc� of eight years who had been killed the year before in the Somme. Explaining why she hadn't married him, she says she was afraid marriage would be bad for him, then admits: <blockquote> I wanted to do something for him. You see, I didn't care about the other thing and he could have had it all. He could have had anything he wanted if I would have known. I would have married him or anything. I know all about it now. But then he wanted to go to war and I didn't know. </blockquote> The two begin an affair, with Henry quite convinced that he "did not love Catherine Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of playing cards." Soon enough, however, the game turns serious for both of them and ultimately Henry ends up deserting to be with Catherine. <p> Hemingway was not known for either unbridled optimism or happy endings, and <i>A Farewell to Arms</i>, like his other novels (<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls</i>, <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, and <i>To Have and Have Not</i>), offers neither. What it <i>does</i> provide is an unblinking portrayal of men and women behaving with grace under pressure, both physical and psychological, and somehow finding the courage to go on in the face of certain loss. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Modern Web: Multi-Device Web Development with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript</h2><p><p><b>A Guide to Modern Web Development</b><br><br></p><p>Today's web technologies are evolving at near-light speed, bringing the promise of a seamless Internet ever closer to reality.

Do individuals drive more cautiously, clear ice from sidewalks more diligently, and commit fewer crimes because of the threat of legal sanctions? Do corporations pollute less, market safer products, and obey contracts to avoid suit? And given the effects of laws, which are socially best? Such questions about the influence and desirability of laws have been investigated by legal scholars and economists in a new, rigorous, and systematic manner since the 1970s. Their approach, which is called economic, is widely considered to be intellectually compelling and to have revolutionized thinking about the law. </p><p>In this book Steven Shavell provides an in-depth analysis and synthesis of the economic approach to the building blocks of our legal system, namely, property law, tort law, contract law, and criminal law. He also examines the litigation process as well as welfare economics and morality. Aimed at a broad audience, this book requires neither a legal background nor technical economics or mathematics to understand it. Because of its breadth, analytical clarity, and general accessibility, it is likely to serve as a definitive work in the economic analysis of law.</p></p><p>Steven Shavell is Samuel R. Rosenthal Professor of Law at Harvard Law School.For the past 30 years, Steven Shavell has been one of the prolific and influential contributors to the economic analysis of law, the foremost intellectual movement in law in the last half century. His new book is a lucid, accessible, authoritative, critical, and comprehensive treatise on the economics of the fundamental doctrines and institutions of the law. It is at once a major contribution to scholarship, a useful reference tool, and a valuable introduction to an approach to law that no serious student of the law can any longer afford to neglect. (Richard A. Posner, Judge, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit)<br><br>Shavell's book provides a masterful, non-technical synthesis of the classical topics of law and economics. It is comprehensive, clear and readable. The book will be a great source both for neophytes who want to learn about this important area, and for experts who want to make sure that they are up-to-date on the latest developments. (Oliver Hart, Department of Economics, Harvard University)<br><br>Law and Economics is one of the great intellectual triumphs of social science. Shavell's book offers a compelling account of the accomplishments and challenges of the field at the beginning of the 21st century. (Andrei Shleifer, Department of Economics, Harvard University)<br><br>Since the 1970s, Steven Shavell has written one path-breaking article after another. Not only has he collected the insights from this large body of work under one roof here, he has added to it both by integrating it into a coherent whole, and by filling in numerous gaps in the literature. For someone interested in getting to the cutting edge of law-and-economics scholarship as quickly as possible, this book is a "must read." It clearly will become the authoritative treatise on the economic analysis of law. (A. Mitchell Polinsky, Stanford Law School)<br><br>This book proposes an overview of the fields in the economics of law to which the author has contributed. It also covers in detail other fields and many contributions to the literature. The emphasis is on theory, but some empirical facts are mentioned...I very much enjoyed reading the book. It covers with great competence the relevant topics of positive and normative analyses of law. The book reflects the strong academic competence of the author. I recommend the book to academics and professionals. I also recommend its use for teaching the economics of law in law schools, economics departments, and business schools.

MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS is highly regarded because it has successfully brought peace to departments that were split between reform and traditional approaches to teaching calculus. Not only does the text help reconcile the two schools of thought by skillfully merging the best of traditional calculus with the best of the reform movement, it does so with innovation and meticulous accuracy.</p><p>The late James Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto. He did research at the University of London and was influenced by the famous mathematician George Polya at Stanford University. Stewart was most recently Professor of Mathematics at McMaster University, and his research field was harmonic analysis. Stewart was the author of a best-selling calculus textbook series published by Cengage Learning, including CALCULUS, CALCULUS: EARLY TRANSCENDENTALS, and CALCULUS: CONCEPTS AND CONTEXTS, as well as a series of precalculus texts."I have appreciated two main things from this textbook. The first is the concise language that Stewart uses. It makes my job much easier. I can embellish, add, emphasize or not easily. The second item is the paring down of the calculus material to an amount that...allows me enough room to add the various exploratory activities that I have my classes use."<br><br>"The single feature of this book that I like the most is the breadth in the exercises."<br><br>"Stewart does a good job in extracting the best parts from calculus reform efforts and traditional approaches. The book is well organized, the material is clearly presented, and there is an abundance of problems of varying levels. The problems are the right type to engage students in thinking about the concepts and to develop skills and ability to apply the calculus.... The organization and presentation is designed to develop perspective, conceptual understanding and ability to use the concepts and methods to actually solve problems." "I like the author's approach very much...it combines the best features of both [the traditional and the reform approaches], making it possible to present a better course. Stewart's approach contains the most important aspects of that [reform] approach--rule of four, use of projects, use of technology, focus on topics of value to clients, development of conceptual understanding over formalism, writing."

Drawing upon a wealth of previously unpublished archival material and correspondence (accompanied by a dazzling array of paintings, drawings, and engravings) Edgar Munhall uses this remarkable work as a starting point for exploring the development of Whistler's art, and in the process paints a delightful and fascinating portrait of the extraordinarily creative and sometimes bizarre avant-garde world of fin-de-siecle Paris and London. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Workforce Education: The Basics</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Businesses and the government are clamoring for a better-prepared workforce.

This unique anthology&#x2013;the first of its kind in fifty years&#x2013;gathers together all of Melville&#x2019;s tales, as well as a judiciously edited array of his prose poems, literary criticism, letters, lectures, and poetry. Though few realize it today, poetry was Melville&#x2019;s abiding passion; yet his poetry has never received the recognition it deserves, until now. <br><br>Containing many writings available nowhere else, and edited by leading Melville scholar John Bryant, Tales, Poems, and Other Writings includes a comprehensive introductory essay and extensive, in many cases groundbreaking, editorial commentary. It opens a window onto Melville&#x2019;s writing process&#x2013;he was a ceaseless reviser and experimenter&#x2013;and reveals his career-long evolution as a writer as well as the full breadth of his literary achievement.

Melville the Seafarer was actually a bookish explorer of words, a note-taking adventurer who sailed the philosophical oceans searching for the text (and the subtext) to address over and over his lifelong obsessions with faith and doubt, sex and art. Here, Bryant shows us the writer who, even when he could no longer make a living of writing, even when he worked in obscurity and despair, was constantly changing, constantly revising, constantly experimenting with new and more beautiful forms&#x2013;a writer who had to keep moving, like a shark."<br>--Robert Sullivan, author of <b>A Whale Hunt and The Meadowlands</b><br><br>"No other anthology presents the extraordinary range of Melville&#x2019;s writing across the second half of the nineteenth century or makes vivid Melville&#x2019;s restless experiments in prose and poetry.

The weapon: a small-caliber revolver. The victims: two young newlyweds, with little money and no known enemies. The puzzle: everyone in the car has an alibi, and no one was seen to leave. Here are all the ingredients for another gripping detective story.<br> <em>The Oxford Book of English Detective Stories</em> gathers 33 engrossing tales of crime, ranging from the birth of the genre to the present day. Arthur Conan Doyle, G.K. Chesterton, Agatha Christie, Dorothy Sayers, Margery Allingham, P.D. James, Ruth Rendell, Robert Barnard, and Simon Brett--all the giants of English mystery are here, as well as Christianna Brand, Ngaio Marsh, Michael Innes, Reginald Hill, Nicholas Blake, Michael Underwood, and many more. Editor Patricia Craig treats us to Sherlock Holmes, indefatigably tracking the details of the theft of Colonel Ross's prize horse, Silver Blaze, and the murder of its trainer. In "The Oracle of the Dog," G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown sits calmly in his study, solving at a distance the perplexing murder of Colonel Druce: was it the foreign Dr. Valentine, the foppish lawyer Traill, or Floyd, the exuberant American secretary? P.D. James sends Chief Superindentant Dalgliesh on the trail of a mysterious death from some seventy years before--a case with a final, darkly ironic twist. And Robert Barnard grimly lampoons English academe in "The Oxford Way of Death." In addition to this dazzling array of stories, Craig provides a concise introduction which surveys the origins and development of this enduring genre.<br> Ingenious, gothic, morbid, satirical--the English detective story ranks among the most dynamic and gripping fiction.

His masterpieces include The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby and Tender Is the Night. He was born in St Paul, Minnesota in 1896, attended Princeton University, and published his first novel, This Side of Paradise, in 1920. He and his wife Zelda divided their time between New York, Paris and the French Riviera, as part of the circle that included Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos. He died in 1940, while working on The Love of the Last Tycoon, which has inspired a new drama series in development, The Last Tycoon.I&#x2019;d Die for You Introduction<p></p> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. it isn&#x2019;t particularly likely that I&#x2019;ll write a great many more stories about young love. I was tagged with that by my first writings up to 1925. Since then I have written stories about young love. They have been done with increasing difficulty and increasing insincerity. I would either be a miracle man or a hack if I could go on turning out an identical product for three decades.<br> <br>I know that is what&#x2019;s expected of me, but in that direction the well is pretty dry and I think I am much wiser in not trying to strain for it but rather to open up a new well, a new vein.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nevertheless, an overwhelming number of editors continue to associate me with an absorbing interest in young girls&#x2014;an interest that at my age would probably land me behind bars.<br> <br>&#x2014;F. Scott Fitzgerald to Kenneth Littauer, editor of Collier&#x2019;s magazine, 1939<br> <br>After his sensational start as a professional writer in 1919, F. Scott Fitzgerald was increasingly stereotyped as a writer of what he himself had dubbed &#x201c;the Jazz Age.&#x201d; Readers, and editors, anticipated from him standard romances, poor boys wooing rich girls, parties and glamour and glib flappers. When he tried something different, in a darker and deeper historical decade, and as a mature man who had lived through much pain, Fitzgerald found it very difficult to break out of this early stereotype. The young writer surrounded by campus life at Princeton (This Side of Paradise) becoming part of a new, golden couple (The Beautiful and Damned) and then the creator and chronicler of the Jazz Age (the story collections of the 1920s, and The Great Gatsby) gives way straight to The Crack-Up in most literary biographies and readers&#x2019; conceptions of Fitzgerald. He wanted, as he put it, to &#x201c;open up a new well, a new vein.&#x201d; Unfortunately, only a very few appreciated what he was trying to do.<br> <br>These stories are about divorce and despair; working days and lonesome nights; smart teenagers unable to attend college or find a job during the Great Depression; American history, with its wars, its horrors, and its promises; sex, with marriage thereafter&#x2014;or not; and the wild, bright vitality and grinding poverty of New York City, a place Fitzgerald truly loved and understood in all its possibilities, shallowness, and ugliness. They show him not as a &#x201c;sad young man&#x201d; growing old, and trapped in the golden days of his own recent past, but at the fore of Modern literature, in all its experimentalism and developing complexities.<br> <br>***<br> <br>F. Scott Fitzgerald, graying and chunking up, is reputedly one of the most difficult authors from whom editors may wangle stories these days. He is the literary symbol of an era&#x2014;the era of the new generation&#x2014;and editors continue to want stories of flask gin and courteous collegiates preceding ladies through windshields on midnight joy rides. The public has acquired this Fitzgerald taste, too. But Fitzgerald has taken an elderly and naturally serious turn. Mellowed is the term. He wants to write mellowly, too. And if they won&#x2019;t let him he won&#x2019;t write at all. So there.<br> <br>&#x2014;O. O. McIntyre, &#x201c;New York Day by Day&#x201d; column, 1936<br> <br>Contemporary editors of popular, mass-market magazines at the time were not philistines, of course. However, there were good reasons for them to shy away from what Fitzgerald was writing by the mid-1930s; some of the stories are dark and stark. Only one editor fully saw the merits of what Fitzgerald was trying to do and published him consistently&#x2014;Arnold Gingrich, of Esquire, a novelist himself. Fitzgerald sold the brilliant Pat Hobby stories to Esquire for $200 or $250 apiece in the two years before his death. (This was a low price to Fitzgerald, but not for a writer during the Depression; and not if you consider its relative worth, when according to the 1940 U.S. Census the average annual income was just over $1,000.) Gingrich encouraged Fitzgerald to turn his fine chronicles of a failed, drunken, Irish-American screenwriter into a novel. But even Gingrich wouldn&#x2019;t go for some stories; Fitzgerald wrote about young men worrying over venereal disease and having gotten sixteen-year-olds pregnant, and Esquire said no thanks.<br> <br>Most of these stories are from the days when America, and the world, was in the Great Depression. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s fortunes, so high just a few years before, had fallen with the country&#x2019;s. He was often sick, often broke, and anxiously shuttling between the Baltimore area&#x2014;where he and Zelda had settled with their daughter, Scottie&#x2014;and a string of health resorts in the North Carolina mountains. After a breakdown in Europe in 1930, Zelda was hospitalized in February 1932 at the Phipps Psychiatric Clinic of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. For the rest of Fitzgerald&#x2019;s life, and hers, Zelda would be in and out of costly private clinics and hospitals; the pressure Scott put on himself to earn enough money to pay for these was immense. From early 1935, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s own health was a concern to him, too, and despite his fear of a recurrence of the tuberculosis with which he&#x2019;d been diagnosed as a young man, he complicated matters by smoking and drinking to excess.<br> <br>However, the first story in this collection, &#x201c;The I.O.U.,&#x201d; comes from Fitzgerald&#x2019;s earliest days as a writer; and the last complete ones, &#x201c;The Women in the House&#x201d; and &#x201c;Salute to Lucy and Elsie,&#x201d; from a stint in Hollywood in 1939 when he had quit drinking and was eagerly working on a new novel, published after his death as The Last Tycoon. There is writing from every stage of his well-chronicled career&#x2014;the youth reveling in bright days and nights of success and celebrity; the husband and father at thirty suddenly plunged into a world of doctors and hospitals because of his wife&#x2019;s illness; a struggling man in poor health himself, looking for that new vein to open up for his own writing; and, above all, a professional writer who never failed to take inspiration and energy from the American landscape and personalities around him. That hunger never ended for F. Scott Fitzgerald, and these stories show it.<br> <br>***<br> <br>Is there any money in collections of short stories?<br> <br>&#x2014;Fitzgerald to his agent, Harold Ober, 1920<br> <br>Short stories were, from the first, Fitzgerald&#x2019;s bread and butter. When Princeton&#x2019;s president, John Grier Hibben, wrote him to complain of, among other things, the characterization of a shallow university and its students in his story &#x201c;The Four Fists&#x201d; (1920), Fitzgerald replied, &#x201c;I wrote it in desperation one evening because I had a three inch pile of rejection slips and it was financially necessary for me to give the magazines what they wanted.&#x201d;<br> <br>To give the magazines what they wanted: that was Fitzgerald&#x2019;s brief as a young writer, and he continued in this very lucrative mode through the 1920s. He sold his work for money and was acutely aware of that fact and of how much he could make, quickly, with short stories, as opposed to waiting until he had enough of a novel complete to consider serialization. He and his family lived well, but after the immense success of his first two novels, The Great Gatsby (1925) did not sell well, and he needed money. Fitzgerald&#x2019;s discouragement over Gatsby&#x2019;s lukewarm reception helped to keep him writing short stories for the Saturday Evening Post and spurred him to turn to work on screenplays in Hollywood as the Jazz Age ended. Fitzgerald was walking the tightrope between art and commerce, and did it as well as any writer of his generation.<br> <br>He was also quite aware of what was his best writing and what was, as he termed it, hack work. Fitzgerald never lied to himself, or anyone else, about the difference between his commercially successful and his imaginatively satisfying stories. He was delighted when the two categories coincided, when stories he valued, like &#x201c;Babylon Revisited,&#x201d; &#x201c;Winter Dreams,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Rich Boy,&#x201d; and the stories about Basil Duke Lee, sold for a high price. He always wished the ones he himself thought best would sell better. &#x201c;I am rather discouraged that a cheap story like The Popular Girl written in one week while the baby was being born brings $1500. + a genuinely imaginative thing into which I put three weeks real entheusiasm [sic] like The Diamond in the Sky [&#x201c;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz&#x201d;] brings not a thing,&#x201d; he wrote to his agent, Harold Ober, in 1922. &#x201c;But, by God + Lorimer, I&#x2019;m going to make a fortune yet.&#x201d; George Horace Lorimer, the Yale graduate who edited the Saturday Evening Post from 1899 to 1936, paid Fitzgerald well for his writing: a fortune, in fact, for a young writer. In 1929 the Post began to pay him $4,000 per story, the equivalent of over $55,000 today. Yet Fitzgerald chafed under the golden chains, telling H. L. Mencken in 1925, just after Gatsby was published:<br> <br>My trash for the Post grows worse and worse as there is less and less heart in it&#x2014;strange to say my whole heart was in my first trash. I thought that the Offshore Pirate was quite as good as Benediction. I never really &#x201c;wrote down&#x201d; until after the failure of the Vegetable and that was to make this book [Gatsby] possible. I would have written down long ago if it had been profitable&#x2014;I tried it unsuccessfully for the movies. People don&#x2019;t seem to realize that for an intelligent man writing down is about the hardest thing in the world.<br> <br>To his editor Maxwell Perkins at Scribner, in the same year, he was blunter and briefer: &#x201c;The more I get for my trash the less I can bring myself to write.&#x201d;<br> <br>Fitzgerald always considered himself a novelist, though he was a superb writer of short fiction&#x2014;not a more humble form of writing than the novel, just briefer. His short stories, loved and well-known, stand alone, but they were often a testing ground for him, a place for rough drafts, an initial space for ideas and descriptions, characters and places, elements of which would find their way into his next novel. The ledger of his life and writings, which Fitzgerald kept until 1938, lists many stories in the &#x201c;Record of Published Fiction&#x201d; section as &#x201c;stripped and permanently buried.&#x201d; That &#x201c;stripping&#x201d; process is readily visible in his tear sheets and on magazine copies of the stories he published, where Fitzgerald revised, redacted, and indicated passages that later appeared in The Beautiful and Damned, The Great Gatsby, and Tender Is the Night.<br> <br>The stories in this collection, most of which are from the middle and late 1930s, feature lines that will be familiar to those who have read Fitzgerald&#x2019;s working papers (published as The Notebooks of F. Scott Fitzgerald in 1978) and The Love of the Last Tycoon, his final novel, left unfinished at his death.<br> <br>***<br> <br>Is there money in writing movies? Do you sell scenarios?<br> <br>&#x2014;Fitzgerald to Harold Ober, December 1919<br> <br>The pull and possibilities of Hollywood, and of writing scenarios and screenplays for movies, were a lure for Fitzgerald from his earliest writing days. In September 1915, when he was a sophomore at Princeton, the Daily Princetonian ran an advertisement that read: &#x201c;Special Notice to Students Who Fail / Motion Picture Studio Work opens an almost immediate field for substantial earnings to young men who possess some natural ability.&#x201d; This equation of motion picture work and failing was writ large for Fitzgerald from his first time in Hollywood. Though several of his stories and two of his novels were made into movies in the 1920s, he did not like them&#x2014;he and Zelda thought the 1926 film version of The Great Gatsby, now lost, was &#x201c;rotten.&#x201d; Nonetheless, in January 1927 the Fitzgeralds settled at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles for three months while Scott worked on a screenplay, made to order, for Constance Talmadge. Talmadge, nicknamed &#x201c;Brooklyn Connie,&#x201d; was a major silent star trying to break into talkie comedies. At first, he and Zelda enjoyed meeting and socializing with movie stars, but it soon wore thin. The screenplay was rejected, and the Fitzgeralds headed home to the East. Zelda reported that Scott &#x201c;says he will never write another picture because it is too hard, but I do not think writers mean what they say[.]&#x201d;<br> <br>She was right. Those unremarkable sales and mixed reviews for The Great Gatsby changed Fitzgerald as a writer. He threatened a future course of action almost immediately, writing to Perkins from Europe in the spring of 1925:<br> <br>In all events I have a book of good stories for the fall. Now I shall write some cheap ones until I&#x2019;ve accumulated enough for my next novel. When that is finished and published I&#x2019;ll wait and see. It if will support me with no more intervals of trash I&#x2019;ll go on as a novelist. If not I&#x2019;m going to quit, come home, go to Hollywood and learn the movie business.<br> <br>In 1931, Fitzgerald went back to Hollywood, again for the money, for another miserable few months that proved creatively fruitless and personally taxing. Tender Is the Night, the novel he had been working on, remained unfinished. And this time, Zelda was not with Scott in Los Angeles; she was at her parents&#x2019; home in Montgomery, Alabama, on the verge of a breakdown that would send her into a hospital the following spring. However, her judgment, in writing to her husband in Hollywood in November 1931, could not be sounder: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry your work isn&#x2019;t interesting. I had hoped it might present new dramatic facets that would make up for the tediousness of it. If it seems too much drudgery and you are faced with &#x2018;get to-gether and talk-it-over&#x2019; technique&#x2014;come home, Sweet. You will at least have eliminated Hollywood forever. I wouldn&#x2019;t stay and waste time on what seems an inevitable mediocrity and too hard going.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though he failed&#x2014;again&#x2014;in Hollywood in 1931, Fitzgerald, needing money&#x2014;again&#x2014;returned there for good in the summer of 1937. The third time was not the charm. In the title story of this collection, we see his view of the movie business&#x2014;the inherent corrosiveness and the danger to individual creativity. Arnold Gingrich had warned Fitzgerald, in 1934, not to go back, and told him why in no uncertain terms: &#x201c;It would be awful to see you piss away your talent in Hollywood again and I hope it won&#x2019;t come to that. Because, regarding the written word like a musical instrument, you are the supreme virtuoso&#x2014;nobody can draw a purer finer tone from the string of an English sentence&#x2014;and what the hell has the written word to do with Hollywood?&#x201d;<br> <br>As Fitzgerald wrote to Perkins shortly before he left for the West Coast, with cold self-knowledge and prescience, &#x201c;Each time I have gone to Hollywood, in spite of the enormous salary, has really set me back financially and artistically.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I certainly have this one more novel [The Love of the Last Tycoon], but it may have to remain among the unwritten books of this world.&#x201d; Fitzgerald&#x2019;s bills were large, for everything from his own living expenses to Zelda&#x2019;s private sanitarium near Asheville, North Carolina, to Scottie&#x2019;s schools. And the contract from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was large, too&#x2014;$1,000 a week for his work as a script doctor. The last few of his stories were written in the time he could borrow from work on the screenplays of others&#x2014;screenplays it was mind-numbing to read, and on which his dismissive comments survive in the margins. The Hollywood work discouraged and literally sickened him, and his lack of enthusiasm for the place is evident in the weakness of his screenplay scenarios. Yet that MGM contract saved Fitzgerald when he was deeply in debt, and he found the material for The Love of the Last Tycoon there. He was happy when he died, working hard on that &#x201c;one more novel,&#x201d; but the psychic and creative costs of selling his talent and time were immense, and surely contributed to that novel remainin...</p><h2>Employment Discrimination Law, Cases and Materials on Equality in the Workplace (American Casebook Series)</h2><p>This book examines the federal statutory protection against employment discrimination, highlighting the themes of workplace equality that are embodied in the civil rights laws.

After the breathtaking debut of Christine Daae, the whispers of an Opera ghost seem to become reality as the young singer vanishes. As the Phantom strikes again and again, targeting foes from a jealous diva to a romantic rival, Leroux spins a thriller of obsession and violence with, at its center, a tormented murderer who awakens our deepest fears and sympathies. The inspiration for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s long-running musical, Leroux&#39;s novel is still more riveting than anything Broadway could produce.</p><h2>The Smile Revolution: In Eighteenth Century Paris</h2><p>You could be forgiven for thinking that the smile has no history; it has always been the same. However, just as different cultures in our own day have different rules about smiling, so did different societies in the past. In fact, amazing as it might seem, it was only in late eighteenth century France that western civilization discovered the art of the smile. In the 'Old Regime of Teeth' which prevailed in western Europe until then, smiling was quite literally frowned upon. Individuals were fatalistic about tooth loss, and their open mouths would often have been visually repulsive. Rules of conduct dating back to Antiquity disapproved of the opening of the mouth to express feelings in most social situations. Open and unrestrained smiling was associated with the impolite lower orders. <br><br>In late eighteenth-century Paris, however, these age-old conventions changed, reflecting broader transformations in the way people expressed their feelings. This allowed the emergence of the modern smile <em>par excellence</em>: the open-mouthed smile which, while highlighting physical beauty and expressing individual identity, revealed white teeth. It was a transformation linked to changing patterns of politeness, new ideals of sensibility, shifts in styles of self-presentation - and, not least, the emergence of scientific dentistry. These changes seemed to usher in a revolution, a revolution in smiling. Yet if the French revolutionaries initially went about their business with a smile on their faces, the Reign of Terror soon wiped it off. Only in the twentieth century would the white-tooth smile re-emerge as an accepted model of self-presentation. <br><br>In this entertaining, absorbing, and highly original work of cultural history, Colin Jones ranges from the history of art, literature, and culture to the history of science, medicine, and dentistry, to tell a unique and untold story about a facial expression at the heart of western civilization.<br></p><p><br><strong>Colin Jones</strong> is Professor of History at Queen Mary University of London.

This book presents a philosophical analysis of QFT. It is the first treatise in which the philosophies of space-time, quantum phenomena, and particle interactions are encompassed in a unified framework. Describing the physics in nontechnical terms, and schematically illustrating complex ideas, the book also serves as an introduction to fundamental physical theories. The philosophical interpretation both upholds the reality of the quantum world and acknowledges the irreducible cognitive elements in its representation. The interpretation is based on an analysis of our ways of thinking as the are embedded in the logical structure of QFT. The author argues that philosophical categories are significant only if they play active and essential roles in our knowledge and hence constitute part of the theories in actual use. Thus she regards physical theories as primary, extracts their categorical structure, and uses it to rethink key philosophical questions. Among the questions this book tries to answer are: What are the quantum properties independent of measurements? How do we refer to individual things in a continuous field? How do theories relate to objects? What are the general conditions of the world and of our ways of thinking that make possible our knowledge of the microscopic realm, which is so intangible and counterintuitive? As a penetrating analysis of vital themes in contemporary science, the book will engage the interest of students and professionals in physics and philosophy alike.<br></p><p>Quantum field theory (QFT) combines quantum mechanics with Einstein&#39;s special theory of relativity and underlies elementary particle physics.

At the time the author was strongly opposed to the view of H. G. Wells that a combination of technology and new political ideologies would lead to a boundless utopia for mankind, with religious belief rejected in favor of broad secularism. <br><br> Repelled by this popular vision of the future, Benson set out to create his own. <i>Lord of the World</i> was the result of his endeavor: it depicts a future in which the Labour Party abolishes many of the scientific, commercial and religious bodies of the United Kingdom, resulting in a mono-culture of communistic rule. The world meanwhile is split between two superpowers - the Eastern Empire whose rule stretches across most of Asia, and the British Empire. <br><br> As the story progresses, the reemergence of religious forces transpires with God appearing to multiple characters. Gradually the forces of organised religion are pushed into violent conflict with the prevailing socialist order. <br><br> To this day <i>Lord of the World</i> is praised for its approach to depicting a world where traditions and faith are abandoned in favor of newer ideologies. It has received praise particularly from figures in the Catholic religion, including compliments from multiple Popes. It also predicted several of the 20th century's technological advancements, namely interstate motorways and the mass commercialization of air travel.</p><p><p>Can a timeless book become timely 100 years after its first appearance?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In this profound and prescient novel, Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson gives us an imaginative foretelling of the end of the world. All stories, Aristotle said, have a beginning, a middle, and an end, but most ends are relative, the terminus of this chain of acts or that. But what of the end that terminates all human action as we know it, the end of time itself, the Second Coming? Since this novel appeared in 1906, many others have been devoted to nuclear disaster, destructive comets, and other hair-raising possibilities. What sets Benson&#x2019;s story apart and makes it as readable today as when it was written is the Catholic and biblical context that provides the ultimate meaning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Hugh Benson (1871&#x2013;1914) was the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and his conversion to Catholicism caused a stir. He became a great apologist for the faith, in spiritual works as well as in works of the imagination. Lord of the World is first of all a tremendous &#x201c;read,&#x201d; but it is also spiritual food for thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The late Ralph McInerny contributed a fine preface to the work, and recently Fr. C. John McCloskey III, a specialist on the work of Robert Hugh Benson, added a fascinating introduction.<br>&nbsp;</p>LORD OF THE WORLD is a bitingly satiric science fiction novel of a secularized world state. As Rosa Mulholland, Lady Gilbert, declared, &#34;It is a brilliant, beautiful, and terrible book,&#34; a judgment in which the public has fully concurred for nearly a century. LORD OF THE WORLD is the only one of Benson s novels to remain continually in print from its first publication in 1907 down to the present day. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen declared, &#34;The three great apocalyptic pieces of literature dealing with the advent of the satanic are Father Hugh Benson s LORD OF THE WORLD, Dostoyevsky s THE BROTHERS KARAMOZOV, and Soloviev s THREE CONVERSATIONS ON WAR.&#34;</p><h2>Wave Me Goodbye: Stories of the Second World War (Virago Modern Classics)</h2><p><p>This collection of short stories written by women when war was a way of life includes some of the finest women writers of that generation. War had traditionally been seen as a masculine occupation but these stories show how women were equal if different participants. Here, war is less about progress on the frontline of battle than about the daily struggle to keep homes, families and relationships alive; to snatch pleasure from danger, and strength from shared experience. The stories are about saying goodbye to husbands, lovers, brothers and sons - and sometimes years later trying to remake their lives anew. By turn comical, stoical, compassionate, angry and subversive these intensely individual voices bring a human dimension to the momentous events that reverberated around them and each opens a window on to a hidden landscape of war.</p><p><b>Writers include: Jean Rhys, Elizabeth Bowen, Elizabeth Taylor, Stevie Smith, Rosamond Lehmann, Barbara Pym, Sylvia Townsend Warner, Dorothy Parker, Doris Lessing, Olivia Manning, Rose Macaulay and Stevie Smith</b></p></p><p></p><h2>Earthrise: How Man First Saw the Earth</h2><p>Tells the story of the first photographs of Earth from space and the unexpected impact of those images.

Culture Wars in the Public Schools</h2><p>What do America's children learn about American history, American values, and human decency? Who decides? In this absorbing book, Jonathan Zimmerman tells the dramatic story of conflict, compromise, and more conflict over the teaching of history and morality in twentieth-century America. <p></p><p> In history, whose stories are told, and how? As Zimmerman reveals, multiculturalism began long ago. Starting in the 1920s, various immigrant groups--the Irish, the Germans, the Italians, even the newly arrived Eastern European Jews--urged school systems and textbook publishers to include their stories in the teaching of American history. The civil rights movement of the 1960s and '70s brought similar criticism of the white version of American history, and in the end, textbooks and curricula have offered a more inclusive account of American progress in freedom and justice. </p><p> But moral and religious education, Zimmerman argues, will remain on much thornier ground. In battles over school prayer or sex education, each side argues from such deeply held beliefs that they rarely understand one another's reasoning, let alone find a middle ground for compromise. Here there have been no resolutions to calm the teaching of history. All the same, Zimmerman argues, the strong American tradition of pluralism has softened the edges of the most rigorous moral and religious absolutism.</p></p><p><b>Jonathan Zimmerman</b> is Professor of Education and History at the Steinhardt School of Education and in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. He spent two years as a teacher with the Peace Corps in Nepal.Zimmerman examines the culture wars that have been fought in America's schools since the Civil War and divides what is commonly held to be one battle into two distinct conflicts, each with its own unique beginnings...By placing these conflicts within their historical context, the author leads readers to a deeper understanding of the issues and how they have influenced and continue to influence public school instruction. [A] landmark piece of scholarship. (Mark Alan Williams <i>Library Journal</i> 2002-08-01)<br><br>Zimmerman argues that the educational wars over religion in the schools and the content of history and social studies courses are separate battles with different stakes, and that the former have been more contentious than the latter. He offers histories of both since the 1920s to illustrate his point and concludes with suggestions about how the religious wars might be resolved. This is a thought-provoking and well-written book...[It] is essential reading for anyone concerned with these issues. (M. Engel <i>Choice</i> 2003-02-01)<br><br>Zimmerman does make a convincing argument. Examples of history textbooks published today substantiate his claim of a diversity coexisting with dullness. So, what exactly does Zimmerman's position mean for the classroom? This book calls for a reexamination of how U.S. history is taught...This call for presenting multiple perspectives in American history classrooms is a timely one.

Together, these two volumes present a detailed study of stairs and ramps -- the art and science of their design, their history, and their hazards.</p><p>For the designer and the art and architectural historian, the first volume treats the fascinating history of stairs and their immense influence on the art and science of architecture. It is illustrated with more than 100 photographs from around the world and reviews the literature on stairs (as well as ladders and railings and ramps) from Vitruvius to Venturi. Templer considers the whole play of meanings in the idea of the stair -- as art object, as structural idea, as legal prescription, or as poetic fancy -- making it clear that the stair is simultaneously an aesthetic, architectonic, ergonomic, and cultural element. The second volume shows the dangers stairs present. Drawing on twenty years of human factors research on stairs, Templer sets out what is known about slips, trips, and falls and how best to design stairs to avoid their inherent dangers. He discusses the physiological and behavioral relationship between humans and stairs and walkways, the question of gait and slippery surfaces, and the various types of falls and the injuries that result. Perhaps most importantly, Templer proposes the idea of the soft stair, which could substantially reduce the annual epidemic of stair-related deaths and injuries.</p></p><p>John Templer, formerly Regents&#39; Professor of Architecture at the Georgia Institute of Technology, has published extensively on architecture including theory, human factors research, and designing for the elderly and disabled. He is also an expert on legal cases involving bodily injury caused by falls.<p>Anyone reading either of these volumes will never be able to look at staircases the same way again. By learning the history of stairs, we appreciate the rich vocabulary possible in their design and bemoan its absence in our era. By learning about safe stair construction, we come to understand how astonishingly little attention has been paid to this subject...If our public spaces are to encourage our sense of self-worth, community, and citizenship; if our private dwellings are to be more than merely machines for living, then books like this pair will undoubtedly form part of our re-education.</p> (Thomas Frick <i>Los Angeles Times</i>)<br><br><p>I have waited a long time to read a work like John Templer's <i>The Staircase</i>. Its achievement of several objectives makes these unique volumes about buildings and about architecture. They blend the joy of aesthetics with the rigor of building science. They draw from historical, laboratory, and field research.

Jean Ayres, Ph.D., more than thirty years ago. Since then, studies by Dr. Miller and her colleagues have helped bring SPD widespread recognition, and her work with families has improved countless lives. Thanks specifically to Dr. Miller's mobilization of the research community, SPD now appears in two diagnostic manuals: the ICDL's <i>Diagnostic Manual for Infancy and Early Childhood</i> and <i>The Diagnostic Classification: Zero to Three</i>. Her application has led to consideration of SPD for inclusion in the 2013 revision of the <i>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-V)</i>. Dr. Miller has also developed seven nationally standardized tests for use worldwide to assess and diagnose SPD and other developmental disorders and delays. &nbsp; Dr. Miller has been featured on NBC's Today Show and ABC's 20/20, in <i>The New York Times</i> and numerous other popular and professional publications. She is the author of more than sixty articles and/or chapters in scientific and professional journals, magazines, and textbooks and is a frequent presenter or speaker at conferences and workshops worldwide. She has received more than thirty funded awards and grants to further research on SPD and other childhood disabilities. &nbsp; In 2004, Dr. Miller received the Award of Merit from the American Occupational Therapy Association, the profession's highest honor.

Taking an anthropological approach to studying gaming on Indian reservations, the case study explores the implications and challenges of historically marginalized peoples now participating in a corporate entertainment industry. The study raises broader questions about the nature of capitalism and the enduring stability of predominant cultural constructs about Indians that have dominated the country&#39;s political and economic arenas. By linking gaming with tourism, what is occurring within the United States is comparatively discussed with similar developments in Canada, Australia, and Mexico where native peoples are increasingly demanding greater rights to participate in the formal institutions and governments of modern western societies. Using extensive interviews with tribal elders, employees of reservation casinos, Las Vegas casino operators, and a broad spectrum of the California public, the book will serve to: 1. Introduce readers to the legal, political, economic and cultural tensions surrounding casino operations on Native American reservations. 2. Explore why gaming has become such a politically and emotionally charged issue. 3. Emphasize how these tensions existing between Indian and non-Indian communities are representative of wider cultural conflicts and identity politics increasingly confronting many countries.</p><p>Eve Darian-Smith is associate professor and chair in the Law and Society Program at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

He lives in Germantown, NY.*Starred Review* To many music-lovers&#x2019; chagrin, the most famous twentieth-century American classical music composition is, very probably, John Cage&#x2019;s 4&#x2019; 33&#x201d; (1952), consisting of three movements whose timings amount to 4 minutes and 33 seconds of . . . music? The question mark arises because not a note is sounded by its performer. It is completely silent. Or is it? For no matter where or how it is played, even in a recording (23 of which Gann lists in an appendix), there are always sounds to be heard. Said by many to be a work of philosophy rather than music, it is, Gann demonstrates, clearly the latter, though Cage was becoming intrigued with Zen when he composed it. And if one of its points is that all sounds are musical, it is fraught with further music-cultural meaning as the culmination of a musical avant-garde extending from Erik Satie in late-nineteenth-century Paris through 1920s Dada to the association of advanced music with abstract expressionist painting after World War II; as the progenitor of at least two styles of subsequent art music, minimalism and environmental sound; and as an astonishing inspiration to a panoply of rock bands. Deftly profiling Cage and his influences in the process, Gann entrancingly communicates his love and fascination with Cage&#x2019;s musical milestone in a spellbinding chapter of high-cultural history. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Texas Politics Today, Enhanced (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>Offering unrivaled coverage of the Lone Star State, TEXAS POLITICS TODAY, ENHANCED, 18th Edition helps you to think critically, get active and find your own place in the current political arena.

But how does news influence an audience's ideas about social structure? <i>Class and News</i> is a multidisciplinary collection of essays examining how the news media treats or neglects this structure in everyday reporting. Are certain stories chosen for their appeal to the upper or middle classes? Are stories of interest to lower class readers/viewers avoided? How are issues of social order reported or reflected in stories that aren't about class? This in-depth work will be a valuable resource for students, scholars, and general readers interested in the dynamics of class and news in the United States.</p><p><b>Don Heider</b> is associate professor of journalism at the University of Texas at Austin.Heider has brought together some excellent current scholarship explicating the very concept of class in America, how news influences people's ideas about class and what people believe and how they act, the way meaning is constructed in news, and how media operate to create or reinforce social values. No doubt the book will enlighten veteran scholars as well as readers who have not given the subject much attention. This book should be essential reading for students and scholars seriously interested in mass communication and society. (<i>Mass Communication and Society</i>)<br><br>Essential.

(<i>Political Communication</i>)<br><br><i>Class and News</i> is a lively anthology of news media studies which brings class and class bias back into media sociology.

Explicitly treated integrable models include the KdV, AKNS, sine-Gordon, and Camassa-Holm hierarchies as well as the classical massive Thirring system. An extensive treatment of the class of algebro-geometric solutions in the stationary and time-dependent contexts is provided. The formalism presented includes trace formulas, Dubrovin-type initial value problems, Baker-Akhiezer functions, and theta function representations of all relevant quantities involved. The book uses techniques from the theory of differential equations, spectral analysis, and elements of algebraic geometry (most notably, the theory of compact Riemann surfaces).</p><p>The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, the AKNS equation, the nonlinear Schr�dinger equation, the sine-Gordon equation, the Thirring system, and the Camassa-Holm equation are all completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equations that permit special classes of solutions. This book offers a detailed treatment of the class of algebro-geometric solutions and their representations in terms of Riemann theta functions. It provides a rigorous and self-contained presentation at the graduate level. Background material is succinctly presented in appendices and detailed notes to each chapter, and an exhaustive bibliography enhances the main text.Fritz Gesztesy is Professor of Mathematics at the University of Missouri, Columbia.</p><h2>The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader</h2><p><p>The first and only book of its kind, <em>The Chicana/o Cultural Studies Reader </em>brings together key writings from experts and contributors in this newly-emerging field. </p> <p></p> <p>The articles embrace a broad range of writing on culture, including TV, film, art, music, dance, theatre and literature.

Peter Pesic argues provocatively that music has had a formative effect on the development of modern science&#x2015;that music has been not just a charming accompaniment to thought but a conceptual force in its own right. </p><p>Pesic explores a series of episodes in which music influenced science, moments in which prior developments in music arguably affected subsequent aspects of natural science. He describes encounters between harmony and fifteenth-century cosmological controversies, between musical initiatives and irrational numbers, between vibrating bodies and the emergent electromagnetism. He offers lively accounts of how Newton applied the musical scale to define the colors in the spectrum; how Euler and others applied musical ideas to develop the wave theory of light; and how a harmonium prepared Max Planck to find a quantum theory that reengaged the mathematics of vibration. Taken together, these cases document the peculiar power of music&#x2015;its autonomous force as a stream of experience, capable of stimulating insights different from those mediated by the verbal and the visual.

This fascinating study explores the important role of language in various aspects of our social life, such as identity, gender relations, class, kinship, status, and hierarchies. Drawing on data from over thirty different languages and societies, it shows how language is more than simply a form of social action; it is also an effective tool with which we formulate models of social life and conduct. These models - or particular forms of social behaviour - are linked to the classification of &#39;types&#39; of action or actor, and are passed &#39;reflexively&#39; from person to person, and from generation to generation. Providing a unified way of accounting for a variety of social phenomena, this book will be welcomed by all those interested in the interaction between language, culture, and society.</p><p>Explores the important role of language in various aspects of our social life, such as identity, gender relations, class, kinship, status, and hierarchies.

The Kawa Model presents a new conceptual model of practice that differs from contemporary theories in regard to: origin (East Asia), underlying philosophical base (East Asia), being heavily infused with a natural-ecological, holistic world view, and relational structure. The model is based on the metaphor of nature (a river) that stands for the meanings of life. Because of the familiarity of the metaphor, to both therapists and clients alike, the Kawa Model is relatively easy to comprehend, remarkably simple, yet comprehensive and effective. Unlike other models, it was raised from clinical practice, by practitioners, through a process of qualitative research methods.

He considers that 20th-century advances in medicine, technology and anthropology have made traditional Judeo-Christian ethics irrelevant and hypocritical. He offers five new commandments: "Recognise that the worth of human life varies" because all life is not of equal value; "Take responsibility for the consequences of your decisions" because the old commandment "never intentionally to take innocent human life" is too absolutist to deal with all the circumstances that can arise; "Respect a person's desire to live or die" because "incurably ill people who ask doctors to help them die are not harming others"; "Bring children into the world only if they are wanted" because being fruitful and multiplying now causes serious overpopulation; "Do not discriminate on the basis of species" because what is "human" can no longer be demonstrated to apply to Homo sapiens alone. Singer analyzes the history of traditional arguments about life and death, with man as the center of the universe, and makes a forceful case for his new ethic. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Methods and Strategies for Teaching Students with Mild Disabilities: A Case-Based Approach</h2><p>METHODS AND STRATEGIES FOR TEACHING STUDENTS WITH MILD DISABILITIES: A Case-Based Approach is intended for undergraduate or graduate students enrolled in a K-12 special education teaching methods course.

Or that drinking a full pot of coffee every morning will add years to your life, but one cup a day increases the risk of pancreatic cancer? All of these &#x201c;facts&#x201d; have been argued with a straight face by credentialed researchers and backed up with reams of data and convincing statistics. As Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist Ronald Coase once cynically observed, &#x201c;If you torture data long enough, it will confess.&#x201d; Lying with statistics is a time-honored con. In Standard Deviations, economics professor Gary Smith walks us through the various tricks and traps that people use to back up their own crackpot theories. Sometimes, the unscrupulous deliberately try to mislead us. Other times, the well-intentioned are blissfully unaware of the mischief they are committing. Today, data is so plentiful that researchers spend precious little time distinguishing between good, meaningful indicators and total rubbish. Not only do others use data to fool us, we fool ourselves. With the breakout success of Nate Silver&#x2019;s The Signal and the Noise, the once humdrum subject of statistics has never been hotter. Drawing on breakthrough research in behavioral economics by luminaries like Daniel Kahneman and Dan Ariely and taking to task some of the conclusions of Freakonomics author Steven D.

THE POTENT COMBINATION of fast computers and worldwide connectivity is continually praised&#x2014;even worshipped. Over and over, we are told that government, business, finance, medicine, law, and our daily lives are being revolutionized by a newfound ability to sift through reams of data and discover the truth. We can make wise decisions because powerful computers have looked at the data and seen the light.</p><p>Maybe. Or maybe not.

In today&#x2019;s Information Age, our beliefs and actions are guided by torrents of meaningless data. It is not hard to see why we repeatedly draw false inferences and make bad decisions. Even if we are reasonably well informed, we are not always alert to the ways in which data are biased or irrelevant, or to the ways in which scientific research is flawed or misleading. We tend to assume that computers are infallible&#x2014;that no matter what kind of garbage we put in, computers will spit out gospel. It happens not just to laymen in their daily lives, but in serious research by diligent professionals. We see it in the popular press, on television, on the Internet, in political campaigns, in academic journals, in business meetings, in courtrooms, and, of course, in government hearings.</p><p>Decades ago, when data were scarce and computers nonexistent, researchers worked hard to gather good data and thought carefully before spending hours, even days, on painstaking calculations. Now with data so plentiful, researchers often spend too little time distinguishing between good data and rubbish, between sound analysis and junk science. And, worst of all, we are too quick to assume that churning through mountains of data can&#x2019;t ever go wrong. We rush to make decisions based on the balderdash these machines dish out&#x2014;to increase taxes in the midst of a recession, to trust our life savings to financial quants who impress us because we don&#x2019;t understand them, to base business decisions on the latest management fad, to endanger our health with medical quackery, and&#x2014;worst of all&#x2014;to give up coffee.</p><p>Ronald Coase cynically observed that, &#x201c;If you torture the data long enough, it will confess.&#x201d; <i>Standard Deviations</i> is an exploration of dozens of examples of tortuous assertions that, with even a moment&#x2019;s reflection, don&#x2019;t pass the smell test.

When my son was old enough, we were in.</p><p>By the time the 2010 World Cup came around, my son was playing on one of the top soccer teams in Southern California. I was the manager and a fanatic about soccer, so naturally he and I watched every World Cup match we could. The opponents in the 2010 championship game were Netherlands and Spain, two extraordinarily talented teams from underachieving nations that often disappointed their supporters. Which country would finally win the World Cup? I loved the Dutch, who had won all six of their World Cup games, scoring twelve goals while allowing only five, and had knocked out the mighty Brazil and Uruguay. But then I heard about Paul the octopus, who had correctly predicted the winners of seven World Cup games by choosing food from plastic boxes with the nations&#x2019; flags on them. Paul the Oracle had picked Spain, and the world now seemed certain of a Spanish victory.</p><p>What the heck was going on? How could a slimy, pea-brained invertebrate know more about soccer than I did? I laughed and waited for Paul the Omniscient to get his comeuppance. Except he didn&#x2019;t. The Dutch did not play with their usual creativity and flair. In a brutal, cynical match, with fourteen yellow cards&#x2014;nine given to the dirty Dutchmen&#x2014;Spain scored the winning goal with four minutes left in the game.</p><p>How could an octopus living in a tank have predicted any of this? Had Paul ever seen a soccer game? Did Paul even have a brain?</p><p>It turns out that octopuses are among the most intelligent invertebrates, but that isn&#x2019;t saying much&#x2014;sort of like being the world&#x2019;s tallest midget. Still, Paul made eight World Cup predictions and got every single one right. Not only that, Paul made six predictions during the 2008 European Football Championships and got four right. Overall, that&#x2019;s twelve out of fourteen correct, which in the eyes of many would be considered statistical proof of Paul&#x2019;s psychic abilities. But were there really enough data?</p><p>If a fair coin is flipped fourteen times, the chances of twelve or more heads are less than one percent. In the same way, if Paul were just a hapless guesser with a 50 percent chance of making a correct prediction, the probability that he would make so many correct predictions is less than 1 percent, a probability so low that it is considered &#x201c;statistically significant.&#x201d; The chances of Paul being correct so many times are so small that, logically, we can rule out luck as an explanation. With his consistency, Paul had demonstrated that he was not merely a lucky guesser. He was truly Paul the Psychic Octopus!</p><p>And yet, something didn&#x2019;t seem quite right. Is it really possible for an octopus to predict the future? Paul&#x2019;s performance raises several issues that are endemic in statistical studies. Paul was not a psychic (surprise, surprise), but he is a warning of things to watch out for the next time you hear some fanciful claim.</p><p> CONFOUNDING EFFECTS</p><p>First, let&#x2019;s look at how Paul made his predictions. At feeding time, he was shown two clear plastic boxes with the national flags of the opposing teams glued to the front of the boxes. The boxes contained identical yummy treats, such as a mussel or an oyster. Whichever box Paul opened first was the predicted winner.</p><p>Octopuses don&#x2019;t know much about soccer, but they do have excellent eyesight and good memories. One time, an octopus at the New England Aquarium decided he didn&#x2019;t like a volunteer and shot salt water at her whenever he saw her. She left the aquarium to go to college, but when she returned months later, the octopus remembered her and immediately drenched her with salt water again. In an experiment at a Seattle aquarium, one volunteer fed the octopuses while another wearing identical clothes irritated the octopuses with a stick. After a week of this, most of the octopuses could tell who was who. When they saw the good person, they moved closer; when they saw the bad person, they moved away (and sometimes shot water at him for good measure).</p><p>Paul the Psychic Octopus happened to be living in an aquarium in Germany and, except for the Spain-Netherlands World Cup final, Paul only predicted games involving Germany. In eleven of the thirteen games involving Germany, Paul picked Germany&#x2014;and Germany won nine of these eleven games. Was Paul picking Germany because he had analyzed their opponents carefully or because he had an affinity for the German flag? Paul was almost certainly color blind, but experiments have shown that octopuses recognize brightness and are attracted to horizontal shapes. Germany&#x2019;s flag has three vivid horizontal stripes, as do the flags of Serbia and Spain, the only other countries Paul selected. Indeed, the Spanish and German flags are pretty similar, which may explain why Paul picked Spain over Germany in one of the two matches they played and picked Spain over the Netherlands in the World Cup final. The only game in which Paul did not choose the German or Spanish flag was a match between Serbia and Germany.</p><p>The flag was apparently a confounding factor in that Paul wasn&#x2019;t picking the best soccer team. He was choosing his favorite flag. Paul the Omniscient was just a pea-brained octopus after all.</p><p><b>Figure 1.1: Paul&#x2019;s Favorite Flags</b></p><p><b>Germany (eleven times)</b></p><p><b>Spain (twice)</b></p><p><b>Serbia (once)</b></p><p> SELECTIVE REPORTING AND MISREPORTING</p><p>Another explanation for Paul&#x2019;s success is that too many pe...</p></p><h2>Gardner&#x2019;s Art Through the Ages (Non-InfoTrac Version)</h2><p>In the mid 1920&#39;s a teacher at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago had a vision to provide students and instructors with a textbook that would introduce them to the artistic legacy of not only Europe, but of the entire globe. In 1926, Harcourt Brace and Company published that vision - ART THROUGH THE AGES. Since that time, Helen Gardner&#39;s vision has been the leader in educating students about the artistic legacy of the world. For the past 75 years, ART THROUGH THE AGES has defined the introductory art history course. The intention of this classic, in Helen Gardner&#39;s words, has been &#34;to introduce the reader to certain phases of art, architecture, painting, sculpture, and the minor arts from the remote days of the glacial age in Europe, through successive civilizations of the Near East, Europe, America, and the Orient, to the twentieth century.&#34; Now, as we begin a new millennium, we do so with the eleventh edition. This text is more accessible and easier to read for students, but does not compromise the richness of the Gardner tradition.</p><p>Fred S. Kleiner (Ph.D., Columbia University) is the author or co-author of the 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th editions of ART THROUGH THE AGES: A GLOBAL HISTORY, as well as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd editions of ART THROUGH THE AGES: A CONCISE HISTORY, and more than 100 publications on Greek and Roman art and architecture, including A HISTORY OF ROMAN ART, also published by Cengage. He has taught the art history survey course for more than three decades, first at the University of Virginia and, since 1978, at Boston University, where he is currently professor of art history and archaeology. From 1985 to 1998, he was editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Archaeology. Long acclaimed for his inspiring lectures and dedication to students, Professor Kleiner won Boston University&#39;s Metcalf Award for Excellence in Teaching, as well as the College Prize for Undergraduate Advising in the Humanities in 2002, and he is a two-time winner of the Distinguished Teaching Prize in the College of Arts and Sciences Honors Program. In 2007, he was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and, in 2009, in recognition of lifetime achievement in publication and teaching, fellow of the Text and Academic Authors Association.&#34;I am a docent trainee at the San Diego Museum of Art - we are using Gardner&#39;s 11th Edition.

Is it possible for life to be meaningful when the world is filled with suffering and when so much depends merely upon chance? Even if there is meaning, is there enough to justify living?<br><br>These questions are difficult to resolve. There are times in which we face the mundane, the illogically cruel, and the tragic, which leave us to question the value of our lives. However, Iddo Landau argues, our lives often are, or could be made, meaningfulwe've just been setting the bar too high for evaluating what meaning there is. <br><br>When it comes to meaning in life, Landau explains, we have let perfect become the enemy of the good. We have failed to find life perfectly meaningful, and therefore have failed to see <em>any</em> meaning in our lives. We must attune ourselves to enhancing and appreciating the meaning in our lives, and Landau shows us how to do that. <br><br>In this warmly written book, rich with examples from the author's life, film, literature, and history, Landau offers new theories and practical advice that awaken us to the meaning already present in our lives and demonstrates how we can enhance it. He confronts prevailing nihilist ideas that undermine our existence, and the questions that dog us no matter what we believe. While exposing the weaknesses of ideas that lead many to despair, he builds a strong case for maintaining more hope. Along the way, he faces provocative questions: Would we choose to live forever if we could? Does death render life meaningless? If we examine it in the context of the immensity of the whole universe, can we consider life meaningful? If we feel empty once we achieve our goals, and the pursuit of these goals is what gives us a sense of meaning, then what can we do? <em>Finding Meaning in an Imperfect</em> <em>World </em>is likely to alter the way you understand your life.<br></p><p><br><strong>Iddo Landau</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Haifa University, Israel. He has published extensively on the meaning of life.<br><br>"...it may very well be the best one on the market. It is accessible to a wide audience, including non-academics. As such, this book could be a good recommended read to persons struggling with finding meaning or work in their lives." -- Caitlin Maples, <em>The Journal of Value Inquiry</em><p></p><br>"[This] book impressively achieves its main goal: Landau improves both academics' and non-academics' thinking about this important topic, and helps us making and considering our lives more meaningful... I hope that similar books will soon further exemplify contemporary analytic philosophy's great potential to inform cognitive therapy or self-help." -- <em>The Philosophical Quarterly </em><p></p><br>"While most of the recent philosophical work on meaning in life is very theoretical, Landau's book is engaging, accessible, and pitched toward those who have genuine concerns about the value or worth of their lives ... This book would work very well in undergraduate courses dealing with meaning in life or well-being. That the book's working account of the meaningful life leaves room for further specification could function as a basis for productive and fun uses in the classroom ... On the whole, Iddo Landau's book is a wonderful contribution. It is a delightful read and should prove a helpful resource for teachers and for researchers who work on the meaning of life. And, perhaps most importantly, this book offers people hope and guidance for living a meaningful life in our all too imperfect world."--Stephen M. Campbell, <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"This book is rare in being thoroughly versed in many philosophical discussions of the meaning of life, yet full of practical wisdom. Completely accessible to anyone who finds the question of meaning urgent, it sets a standard few discussions of the topic manage to reach." --Simon Blackburn, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, Research Professor at UNC Chapel Hill, and Professor at the New College of the Humanities <br><p></p><br>"A deep exploration of the main questions and answers in the meaning of life literature. A pleasure to read." --Owen Flanagan, James B. Duke Professor of Philosophy at Duke University <br> <br><p></p><br>"Written for the generally educated reader, but of interest to the professional philosopher, Iddo Landau's book is a guide to making life meaningful under less than ideal conditions. Landau is a careful, informed navigator, showing the reader how to reach a meaningful life despite obstacles such as suffering, death, evil, randomness, and a lack of free will. Making insightful philosophical points without jargon, referring to literature and the arts to illustrate, and also plumbing people's psychologies to identify mental blocks, Landau's book is practically wise and theoretically profound." --Thaddeus Metz, Distinguished Research Professor, University of Johannesburg <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Selected Poems: with parallel French text (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><strong>'In the end you're tired of this antiquated world'</strong><br><br>Guillaume Apollinaire (1880-1918) is the most significant French poet of early modernism, and the most colourful. His exuberant, adventurous poetry matched the eventful times through which he lived, and his experimentalism heralded a new artistic order. In the Paris of the belle epoque, Apollinaire's prolific writing - poems, short stories, erotic novels, art criticism - as well as his magnetic personality brought him fame and even some notoriety. His two great collections of poetry, <em>Alcools</em> and <em>Calligrammes</em>, made his reputation, and they include love poems as well as the war poetry for which he is best known. Apollinaire coined the word 'surrealism', and he led the literary and artistic avant-garde right up to his death two days before the Armistice, weakened by injuries received earlier in the War. <br><br>This new selection by Martin Sorrell covers the full range of Apollinaire's career, and includes some of the poet's inventive pictorial calligrams.

Progress in other areas of philosophical research has often depended crucially on epistemological presuppositions. This Companion, with well over 250 articles ranging from summary discussions to major essays on topics of current controversy, is the first complete reference work devoted to the subject. All the main theoretical positions in epistemology are discussed and analysed, together with the different categories of knowledge itself - scientific, historical, mathematical, a priori, moral, and so on - and the special problems associated with these. There are also many entries covering individual concepts, arguments and problems, short definitions of technical terms, and biographical articles.<br>With its unrivalled coverage of the field, supported by a comprehensive index and an extensive system of cross-referencing, the Companion is likely to remain the standard reference work in epistemology from undergraduate level upward for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Since its first publication, <i>A Companion to Epistemology</i> has established itself as the leading single-volume epistemology reference work in the field. This extended and revised edition brings the companion up to date. Part I, consisting of newly commissioned review essays, focuses on the major topics that have an abiding centrality for the field, including a priori justification, Bayesian epistemology, closure, contextualism, epistemic virtue, internalism vs. externalism, foundationalism vs. coherentism, perception, scepticism, and social epistemology.

When did the coffee-table book become an object of scorn? Why did law courts forbid witnesses to kiss the Bible? What made Victorian cartoonists mock commuters who hid behind the newspaper, ladies who matched their books' binding to their dress, and servants who reduced newspapers to fish 'n' chips wrap?</p><br><p> Shedding new light on novels by Thackeray, Dickens, the Bront�s, Trollope, and Collins, as well as the urban sociology of Henry Mayhew, Leah Price also uncovers the lives and afterlives of anonymous religious tracts and household manuals. From knickknacks to wastepaper, books mattered to the Victorians in ways that cannot be explained by their printed content alone. And whether displayed, defaced, exchanged, or discarded, printed matter participated, and still participates, in a range of transactions that stretches far beyond reading.</p><br><p> Supplementing close readings with a sensitive reconstruction of how Victorians thought and felt about books, Price offers a new model for integrating literary theory with cultural history. <i>How to Do Things with Books in Victorian Britain</i> reshapes our understanding of the interplay between words and objects in the nineteenth century and beyond.</p></p><p><p>"Beautifully written, this superb book gives us a magnificent study of the social lives of books and texts in the Victorian period: their uses as missiles, doorstops, food wrapping, spouse-ignoring devices, and vehicles for individuation, spiritual development, and childlike wonder and delight. A joy to read."<b>--Elaine Freedgood, New York University</b></p><p>"This timely and witty book is more than a shrewd look at the social lives of book-objects and their users, and a reconstruction of the protocols organizing that use. It also provides, gloriously, a new interpretation of the Victorian novel."<b>--Deidre Lynch, University of Toronto</b></p><p>"Price has written an exceptional book of literary history that stretches the boundaries of what literary history means and does. Making her argument through an astonishing range of evidence about the uses of books, paper, and printed material in the nineteenth century, she shows that reading is not the only thing to do with books, either as objects or as historical evidence.

This unique compilation of over 1,100 prayers combines the traditional with the modern, stretching from the Bible, the saints and mystics of the past, and the Book of Common Prayer, to a Ghanaian fisherman's prayer, and prayers from many influential non-Christian religions.<br> Selected for their literary merit as well as spiritual quality, these prayers speak to the modern reader. Arranged under headings such as "Prayers from the Scripture," "Prayers of Christians, Personal and Occasional," and "Prayers of Other Traditions of Faith," the anthology includes a subject index to guide the reader to prayers for particular occasions, as well as an index of authors and sources.

Spending over 4 years in Paris studying classic works at the Louvre, he developed a formidable technique, evident in his beautiful rendering of the light playing on surfaces. According to those who knew him, John Koch composed his persona as carefully as he arranged his still lifes and interiors. His wife, Dora Zaslavsky, was an esteemed piano coach, and together they created a private world, as Koch wrote, &#39;out of the substance of the city&#39;. Typified by his interest in the interaction between people and the space around them, as well as the interplay of music and art, Koch&#39;s work resisted the prevalent trend towards abstraction. Instead it recorded members of John and Dora&#39;s circle (artists, writers and musicians), who participated in the European-style salon as an oasis of high culture and refinement in New York City.</p><p>Michael M.

Julius focuses on four distinct versions of English anti-Semitism. He first describes the anti-Semitism of medieval England, a radical prejudice of defamation, expropriation, and murder, which culminated in 1290, the year Edward I expelled the Jews from England. The second strand is literary anti-Semitism, from the anonymous medieval ballad "Sir Hugh, or the Jew's Daughter," through Chaucer's "The Prioress's Tale" and Shakespeare's <em>Merchant of Venice</em>, to T. S. Eliot and beyond. The third is modern anti-Semitism, the commonplace anti-Semitism of insult and exclusion, running from the mid-17th century through to the late 20th century. The final chapters then deal with contemporary anti-Semitism, emerging in the late 1960s and the 1970s, which treats Zionism and the State of Israel as illegitimate Jewish enterprises.<br></p><p><br><strong>Anthony Julius</strong> is Chairman of the London Consortium, a Visiting Professor at Birkbeck College, University of London, and Vice-President of the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund.<br>Review from previous edition: "This is an essential history and so it's fortunate it has been written by a man with the extraordinary fluency, staggering erudition, scholarly integrity, intellectual acumen, and moral discernment of Anthony Julius."<br><br>--Philip Roth<br><br>"Julius's book is... the gold standard work on the subject of English antisemitism."<br><br>--David Aaronovitch , The Jewish Chronicle, 17/06/2010<br><br>"Anthony Julius has produced a brilliant and readable account of a shameful stain on the national reputation. The best dissection I've seen of Britain's oldest and least acknowledged racial prejudice."<br><br>--Nick Cohen<br><br>"Part history of an irrational hatred, part forensic analysis of a sophistical lie, part literary criticism - for, as Anthony Julius shows, anti-Semitism is a species of fantastical literature, all figure of speech, misquotation and fancy - this exhilarating work nails a defamation which to<br>humanity's discredit, persists to this hour.

In all the tumult leading to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of new Arab states, Faisal was a central player. His life traversed each of the important political, military, and intellectual developments of his times.&nbsp;This comprehensive biography is the first to provide a fully rounded picture of Faisal the man and Faisal the monarch. Ali A. Allawi recounts the&nbsp;dramatic events of his subject&#x2019;s life and provides a reassessment of his crucial role in developments in the pre&#x2013; and post&#x2013;World War I Middle East and of his lasting but underappreciated influence in the region even 80 years after his death.&nbsp;A battle-hardened military leader who, with the help of Lawrence of Arabia, organized the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire; a leading representative of the Arab cause, alongside Gertrude Bell, at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919; a founding father and king of the first independent state of Syria; the first king of Iraq&#x2014;in his many roles Faisal overcame innumerable crises and opposing currents while striving to build the structures of a&nbsp;modern state.

Rather, pressure from special interest groups, legislative bargaining, and the desire of incumbents to be reelected are thought to originate in American legislative politics. While not denying such influences, Joseph M. Bessette argues that the institutional framework created by the founding fathers continues to foster a government that is both democratic and deliberative, at least to some important degree.<br> <br> Drawing on original research, case studies of policymaking in Congress, and portraits of American lawmakers, Bessette demonstrates not only the limitations of nondeliberative explanations for how laws are made but also the continued vitality of genuine reasoning on the merits of public policy. Bessette discusses the contributions of the executive branch to policy deliberation, and looks at the controversial issue of the proper relationship of public opinion to policymaking.<br> <br> Informed by Bessette's nine years of public service in city and federal government, <i>The Mild Voice of Reason</i> offers important insights into the real workings of American democracy, articulates a set of standards by which to assess the workings of our governing institutions, and clarifies the forces that promote or inhibit the collective reasoning about common goals so necessary to the success of American democracy.<br> <br> "No doubt the best-publicized recent book-length work on Congress is columnist George Will's diatribe in praise of term limits in which the core of his complaint is that Congress does not deliberate in its decision-making. Readers who are inclined to share that fantasy would do well to consult the work of Joseph M. Bessette. He turns up massive amounts of material attesting to the centrality of deliberation in congressional life."&#x2014;Nelson W. Polsby, <i>Presidential Studies Quarterly</i></p></p><p>Joseph M.

After a detailed discussion of the dynamics of moving the tool, (including the broad edged pen, pointed pen and brush) it proceeds to develop an alphabet of strokes used to build and analyze flourishes. A complete chapter on the design principles used to evaluate flourishes is followed by the application of the technique to different situations and to the basic calligraphic scripts. Special attention is paid to Italic and Gothic scripts, with the material on Fraktur leading to a detailed study of the cadel flourish. Numerous examples by leading artists are also included.

His diary, translated into English for the first time, is a powerful and important document that rings with the moral force and literary skill of an Old Testament prophet. The sections preserved cover only the period from April 1942 to January 1943, but Lewin hears all, sees all, records all: the starvation and disease, the desperate grasping for signs of hope; the cooperation among Poles and Jews; the children smuggling food; the slaughter of Jews in surrounding communities and then in the sealed-off Warsaw ghetto; the daily deportations to the Treblinka death camp (which took his wife from him). Lewin's absolute clarity of vision gives this grim document compelling power. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Infinity Puzzle: Quantum Field Theory and the Hunt for an Orderly Universe</h2><p>Speculation is rife that by 2012 the elusive Higgs boson will be found at the Large Hadron Collider. If found, the Higgs boson would help explain why everything has mass. But there s more at stake what we re really testing is our capacity to make the universe reasonable. Our best understanding of physics is predicated on something known as quantum field theory. Unfortunately, in its raw form, it doesn t make sense its outputs are physically impossible infinite percentages when they should be something simpler, like the number 1. The kind of physics that the Higgs boson represents seeks to renormalize field theory, forcing equations to provide answers that match what we see in the real world.

He lives in Abingdon, England.<b>Amsterdam, 1971</b><br><br><i>And now I introduce Mr. &#x2019;t Hooft, who has a theory that is at least as elegant as anything we have heard before.</i><br>&#x2014;Tini Veltman, &#x201c;amsterdam international conference on elementary particles,&#x201d; 1971<br><br>Tini Veltman is a contrarian: a forthright man who has never shied away from controversy. His single-mindedness has brought him success where others either gave up or didn&#x2019;t even dare to try. It is the characteristic that set him on course to a Nobel Prize for Physics. Part of the reason for his triumph was the fortune to have a student whose genius was in constructing a masterpiece by using tools that Veltman had forged. Veltman and his protege, Gerard &#x2019;t Hooft, are like chalk and cheese. Veltman is a big man, with a fulsome beard, often found with a cigar stuck in the corner of his mouth or waved between his fingers as he holds court. His near-perfect English resonates with Dutch vowels as he dismisses some rival&#x2019;s work as &#x201c;baloney&#x201d; or &#x201c;crap.&#x201d; This blunt approach can mislead, obscuring a sensitive and thoughtful personality, with deeply held convictions about the way science should be conducted. His nickname, &nbsp;&#x201c;Tini&#x201d;&#x2014;an abbreviation of Martinus&#x2014;is ironic given his stature, in all senses of the word.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x2019;t Hooft, by contrast, slight in build, with thinning hair, dressed smartly in jacket and tie, and with a small mustache, could easily be mistaken for an English country doctor or an accountant. During discussions, I am often possessed by a sense that he already knows what he is being told and is politely waiting to hear something novel. When he speaks, there is no doubt that he is correct: His soft voice carries real force, aided by a dry sense of humor.<br>&nbsp;<br>Forty years ago, their meeting would change the world of physics. However, today, Veltman&#x2014;the teacher whose ideas enabled his star pupil to produce his magnum opus&#x2014;and &#x2019;t Hooft have drifted apart. In Veltman&#x2019;s own book about particle physics, &#x2019;t Hooft&#x2019;s appearance is limited to a photograph and a few lines of text. He describes &#x2019;t Hooft&#x2019;s breakthrough as &#x201c;a splendid piece of work,&#x201d; which, enigmatically, he was very happy with &#x201c;at the time.&#x201d; That is how it was in 1971, when Veltman &#x201c;proudly introduced&#x201d; his young maestro to the world.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>The Infinity Puzzle<br></b><br>A half century or so ago, and more than two thousand years after the philosophers of ancient Greece had first conceived of atoms, these basic pieces of matter had been revealed to consist of smaller particles, of lightweight electrons remotely encircling a bulky central nucleus.<br>&nbsp;<br>In the aftermath of Hiroshima, where the nuclear atom&#x2019;s explosive power had been revealed, understanding the nature of the atomic nucleus and the mysterious forces that control it was what defined the new frontier. That the nucleus of an atom has a labyrinthine structure of its own was already apparent; the surprise was that the closer that scientists looked at it, the more complicated things appeared to be. And to cap it all, strange particles&#x2014;similar to those found on Earth, yet behaving in other ways&#x2014;were discovered to be pouring down from the heavens, as the result of cosmic rays from outer space smashing into the atmosphere above our heads. Exotic forms of matter, whose existence had not been dreamed of by scientists in their earthbound laboratories, were changing our whole perception of nature. Any theory of the universe had to explain them.<br>&nbsp;<br>This was a time when the pursuit of breakthroughs had become the physics world&#x2019;s equivalent of the Klondike gold rush. Some theoretical high-energy physicists staked their claims with half-baked theories, which they published in obscure journals. The logic seemed to be that if your idea turned out to be wrong, few would notice and the paper would be quietly forgotten. However, if it turned out that a discovery proved your idea to have been correct, you could then refer the world back to your paper and claim priority.<br>&nbsp;<br>Throughout this febrile period, one problem stood out, resisting all attempts at a solution. This was what I call the &#x201c;Infinity Puzzle.&#x201d; Three great theories&#x2014;Maxwell&#x2019;s theory of electromagnetism of the nineteenth century, Einstein&#x2019;s theory of special relativity of 1905, and Quantum Mechanics, developed in the 1920s&#x2014;individually made profound predictions that turned out to be completely accurate: for example, the description of light as electromagnetic waves with a constant speed; the conversion of mass into energy via E=mc2, where <i>c </i>is the speed of light; and the explanation of the stability of atoms, with a quantitative description of their beautiful spectra. In the 1930s the union of these theories gave birth to a complete theory of electromagnetic force and how light interacts with atoms, known as Quantum Electrodynamics, or QED. Initially, it appeared beautifully seductive, but what at first had appeared to be a Cinderella soon threatened to become an Ugly Sister. When the equations of QED were applied beyond the simplest approximations, they seemingly kept predicting that the chance of some things occurring was &#x201c;infinite percent.&#x201d; Why is this a problem? The answer is that infinity is transcendent, beyond measure, signifying a failure of understanding rather than a real answer.<br>&nbsp;<br>To put this into context, the probability of chance can range from zero (that I will never win the lottery, for instance, as I never buy a ticket) to an absolute certainty at 100 percent (death and taxes). &#x201c;Infinity,&#x201d; by contrast, is boundless and immeasurable; it has no quantifiable meaning. In the context of the questions that the scientists were posing, the answer was nonsense, analogous to your computer giving you an error message: &#x201c;computer violation&#x201d; or &#x201c;overflow.&#x201d; When this happens it is usually a hint that you have made some catastrophic error&#x2014;such as instructing the machine to divide by zero. Or it may be a sign that there is a glitch in your computer, perhaps even that the machine itself has been assembled incorrectly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;Without doubt &#x201c;overflow&#x201d;&#x2014;or in our example, infinity&#x2014;is telling you that something is wrong; the problem is: What to do about it?<br>&nbsp;<br>Nor was this a nonsense confined to some arcane piece of atomic science, for this enigma touched upon our ability to understand the principles underlying some of the most basic and far-reaching phenomena. Plants grow as their atoms absorb energy from light, for instance; radio waves result when electric charges are disturbed by electric or magnetic forces; and much of modern electronic technology involves the interactions between electromagnetic radiation and electrons. Each of these&#x2014; whole industries and indeed many forms of life itself&#x2014;depends on a simple underlying mechanism: an electron absorbing or emitting a photon, which is the basic particle of light. Yet QED seemed unable to agree with even this most rudimentary of processes. If, as QED seemingly implied, the chance of a photon being absorbed by an atom was infinite, then photosynthesis and indeed many chemical reactions would happen instantaneously. Life would have burned itself out long ago, if indeed it had ever begun.<br>&nbsp;<br>For physicists, <i>infinity </i>is a code word for disaster, the proof that you are trying to apply a theory beyond its realm of applicability. In the case of QED, if you can&#x2019;t calculate something as basic as a photon being absorbed by an electron, you haven&#x2019;t got a theory&#x2014;it&#x2019;s as fundamental as that.<br>&nbsp;<br>One particular example of this catastrophe is the magnitude of an electron&#x2019;s magnetism, which experiments could measure relative to some standard scale. By using the standard theory, that is, QED, physicists expected to be able to compute this number. All that is required is to solve the algebraic equation describing an electron absorbing a single photon.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is standard fare in undergraduate physics, and I can well recall the joy I felt when, back in 1967, I first carried out the calculation myself. I thought that at last I had qualified as a theorist. Unfortunately, I then learned that this was just the first of a whole series of calculations that would be needed in order to arrive at the true answer; furthermore, my tutor had glossed over the fact that if I were somehow able to do this momentous task, and then to add up the total, the answer would turn out to be infinity. Unknown to me at that time, a few hundred miles away, in Holland, I had a contemporary named Gerard &#x2019;t Hooft, who was also being exposed to the mysteries of infinity and within five years would gain scientific immortality by solving them.</p><h2>The Film Editing Room Handbook: How to Tame the Chaos of the Editing Room</h2><p>The assistant film editor has many more responsibilities than simply helping to edit the picture. He or she must work with all the numerous members of the filmmaking team, juggle the demands of copious amounts of footage from various sources, keep notes during the shoot&#x2019;s dailies screenings, process sound, oversee the creation of optical effects and integrate them in the editor&#x2019;s workflow, and many more detail-oriented, simultaneous tasks that require skills on a technical and organizational level.

A new series of twenty distinctive, unforgettable Penguin Classics in a beautiful new design and pocket-sized format, with coloured jackets echoing Penguin&#39;s original covers.</p><p>Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 in the Tula province. He studied at the University of Kazan, then led a life of pleasure until 1851 when he joined an artillery regiment in the Caucasus. He established his reputation as a writer with The Sebastopol Sketches (1855-6). After a period in St Petersburg and abroad, he married, had thirteen children, managed his vast estates in the Volga Steppes and wrote War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). A Confession (1879-82) marked a spiritual crisis in his life, and in 1901 he was excommuincated by the Russian Holy Synod. He died in 1910, in the course of a dramatic flight from home, at the railway station of Astapovo.</p><h2>Horizons: The Poetics and Theory of the Intermedia</h2><p><p>Written for the lay reader as well as for academic literary theorists, this book bridges the gulf between the artistic avant-garde in music, visual arts, and&nbsp; experimental literature and the general pub�lic.

His poetics travel some distance from the poetry of the past. Here he uses the fu�sion of the receiver&#x2019;s&#x201d; and the artist&#x2019;s horizons, their knowledge, feelings, ex�periences, and imaginings to provide a vivid account of artistic experimentation over the last thirty years.</p></p><p><p><b>Dick Higgins</b> is a writer, artist, and composer.

He connects these themes of today's world with his usual clear-sighted and far-reaching style to create a work which encapsulates his essential and strongest writings in one volume.<br><br>Under the three headings, Drucker covers aspects such as what the non-profits are teaching business and the information that executives need today. In his section on the individual he gives advice on knowing your own strengths and values, your time and, intriguingly, the second half of your life. The third part on society encompasses the coming of the entrepreneurial society and citizenship through the social sector. <br><br>* A timeless classic from Peter F. Drucker, one of the world's leading management thinkers.<br>* wide-ranging book,looks at management, the individual and society<br>* A bestseller in the Drucker Classic Collection<br></p><p>Ever since his first book was published some six decades ago, Peter Drucker has been essential to everyone serious about the "management of an enterprise (and) the self-management of the individual, whether executive or professional, within an enterprise and altogether in our society of managed organizations." This distinguished 30-year Claremont University professor has continuously identified critical principles in management, economics, politics, and the world in general. And he has redirected our thinking about them through more than two dozen books, including an autobiography and a couple of works of fiction. Now, with <i>The Essential Drucker</i>, he has overseen the compilation of his most important fundamentals into one indispensable book. <p> Reaching back as far as 1954 with his treatise "Management by Objectives and Self-Control" ("Each manager, from the 'big boss' down to the production foreman or the chief clerk, needs clearly spelled-out objectives" that clarify expected contributions "to the attainment of company goals in all areas of the business"), Drucker's now-established ideas take on a surprising new relevancy when remixed equally pioneering ideas from the 1960s, '70s, '80s, and '90s. Between the thoughtful "Management as Social and Liberal Art" through the provocative "From Analysis to Perception--The New Worldview" (both originally published in 1988's <i>The New Realities</i>), this book revisits some of modern management's most inspired writing and presents it in a way that should appeal to both newcomers and those needing a refresher course on Drucker's basic beliefs. --<i>Howard Rothman</i></p>Born in Vienna in 1909, Peter F. Drucker was educated in Austria and England. From 1929 he was a newspaper correspondent abroad and an economist for an international bank in London. Since 1937 he has been in the United States, first as an economist for a group of British banks and insurance companies, and later as a management consultant to several of the country's largest companies, as well as leading companies abroad. Drucker has since had a distinguished career as a teacher, first as Professor of Politics and Philosophy at Bennington College, then for more than twenty years as Professor of Management at the Graduate Business School of New York University. Since 1971 he has been Clarke Professor of Social Science at Claremont Graduate School in California. In addition to his management books, Peter Drucker is also renowned for his prophetic books analysing politics, economics and society. These books span fifty years of modern history beginning with The End of Economic Man (1939) and including The Practice of Management; Innovation and Entrepreneurship; Managing in the Next Society; Management Challenges in the 21st Century; The Effective Executive and The Essential Drucker.<p></p></p><h2>Helen Steiner Rice-The Healing Touch: Poems, Letters, and Life Stories</h2><p>Published by Fleming H. Revell, 1998, this First Edition hardcover has 219 pages. Author Helen Steiner Rice, once a household recognized name because of her prodigious output of inspirational poems ( often scorned by intellectuals) left her positive mark and messages on thousands. Written by Ronald Pollitt and Virginia Wiltse, this books reveals several stories of individuals who experienced healing from Helen&#39;s poetry.</p><p>Helen Steiner Rice's life could probably be summed up in the fact that she always met every circumstance with a grateful heart, trusting that God worked out all things for the best. Pollitt and Wiltse draw upon Rice's poems, letters and anecdotes to tell the poet's life story. Rice bore many adversities in her life, including the suicide of her young husband and a painful degenerative disease that led to her infirmity. Yet, as the authors demonstrate, Rice met these adversities with an enduring confidence in God's love and providence, and such attitudes are abundant in her poetry and letters. In addition to recounting Rice's biography, the authors also include testimonies of those influenced by her life and work. The book is divided into six sections dealing with healing the pain of loss, adversity, loneliness, depression, disability and infirmity. In each section, Rice's elegant poetry acts as a light shining through the darkness of pain. While some readers may find the book saccharine, Rice's fans will flock to it. <p></p><p>Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>My Nigeria: Five Decades of Independence</h2><p><p>His nineteenth-century cousin, paddled ashore by slaves, twisted the arms of tribal chiefs to sign away their territorial rights in the oil-rich Niger Delta. Sixty years later, his grandfather helped craft Nigeria's constitution and negotiate its independence, the first of its kind in Africa. Four decades later, Peter Cunliffe-Jones arrived as a journalist in the capital, Lagos, just as military rule ended, to face the country his family had a hand in shaping.</p><p>Part family memoir, part history, <i>My Nigeria</i> is a piercing look at the colonial legacy of an emerging power in Africa. Marshalling his deep knowledge of the nation's economic, political, and historic forces, Cunliffe-Jones surveys its colonial past and explains why British rule led to collapse at independence. He also takes an unflinching look at the complicated country today, from email hoaxes and political corruption to the vast natural resources that make it one of the most powerful African nations; from life in Lagos's virtually unknown and exclusive neighborhoods to the violent conflicts between the numerous tribes that make up this populous African nation. As Nigeria celebrates five decades of independence, this is a timely and personal look at a captivating country that has yet to achieve its great potential.</p></p><p>Peter Cunliffe-Jones has been a foreign correspondent for over 20 years for <i>The Economist</i>, <i>The Independent </i>and the Paris-based Agence France Presse news agency where he is now a senior editor.

One of these is what mathematicians call the &#34;Ruth-Aaron pair&#34; (714 and 715), named after the respective career home runs of Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron. These two consecutive integers contain a host of interesting features, one of which is that their prime factors when added together have the same sum. The authors also explore the unusual aspects of such numbers as 11 and 18, which have intriguing properties usually overlooked by standard math curriculums. And to make you a better all-around problem solver, a variety of problems is presented that appear simple but have surprisingly clever solutions.If math has frustrated you over the years, this delightful approach will teach you many things you thought were beyond your reach, while conveying the key message that math can and should be anything but boring.</p><p><b>ALFRED S.

Valerius knows his only hope of long term survival and a restoration of his family&#x2019;s fortunes lie with his friend Titus, commander of the Army of Judaea and son of the newly crowned Emperor Vespasian. But when he reaches the ring of legionary camps around the seemingly impregnable city of Jerusalem, he finds Titus a changed man. Gone is the cheerful young officer he knew, replaced by a tough, ruthless soldier under pressure from his father to end the insurrection at any cost. Soon, Valerius finds himself at the center of a web of intrigue spun by Titus&#x2019;s lover, Queen Berenice of Cilicia, and her sometime ally, the general&#x2019;s turncoat adviser, Flavius Josephus, who have an ulterior motive for ending the siege quickly.

James Reichley</b> is senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute at Georgetown University.Good for Jim Reichley, a calm and intelligent voice in our era of political darkness. He gives a delightful short course on where political parties come from and why they are necessary. He does not dodge the difficulties of today's system but, thank God, he is not overwhelmed by despair. This is a book of hope for strong, meaningful politics, the life blood of democracy. (Hugh Sidey, TIME MAGAZINE)<br><br>The culmination of a lifetime of reflection on American politics, <i>The Life of the Parties</i> carries authority not least because Reichley himself was a practitioner of the art of government. Combining a truly rare knowledge of political history, a keen eye for telling detail, and a wealth of fresh and original research, he provides us not only with a sober, judiciously argued warning about the health of American politics, but with a positive account intended to set an agenda for feasible reform. (Richard M. Valelly, Swarthmore College, author of Radicalism in the States: The Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party and the American Political Economy)<br><br>Reichley's rich history of the party system is especially appropriate for these unhappy times, when so many are questioning the parties' worth. One cannot read Reichley's work without condcluding that the political parties&#x2015;imperfect instruments though they be&#x2015;have generally been and still are worthwhile and essential institutions in American life.

This governmentality perspective has had important implications for a range of academic disciplines including criminology, political theory, sociology and psychology and has generated much theoretical innovation and empirical investigation. The second edition contains a new introduction, which sets out the methodological and conceptual bases of this approach. Also, a new final chapter has been added that considers some of the implications of recent developments in the government of subjectivity.</p><p>Nikolas Rose is Professor of Sociology and Head of Department of Social Science, Health and Medicine at Kings College London.It&#39;s the mark of a good book that distance enhances value. This appraisal of the role which the human sciences have played in the production of selves at once governable and self-governing still bites. Rose shows how political technologies reappear as canons of personal ethics, and thus points to self transforming properties in our practices of understanding and intervention at the very junctures where we take &#34;ourselves&#34; most seriously. A brilliant intervention itself. It is great stuff. Professor Marilyn Strathern, Department of Social Anthropology, University of Cambridge</p><h2>World Monarchies and Dynasties</h2><p>Throughout history, royal dynasties have dominated countries and empires around the world. Kings, queens, emperors, chiefs, pharaohs, czars - whatever title they ruled by, monarchs have shaped institutions, rituals, and cultures in every time period and every corner of the globe. The concept of monarchy originated in prehistoric times and evolved over centuries right up to the present. Efforts to overthrow monarchies or evade their rule - such as the American, French, Chinese, and Russian revolutions - are considered turning points in world history. Even today, many countries retain their monarchies, although in vastly reduced form with little political power. One cannot understand human history and government without understanding monarchs and monarchies. This fully-illustrated encyclopedia provides the first complete survey of all the major rulers and ruling families of the world, past and present. No other reference work approaches the topic with the same sense of magnitude or connection to historical context. Arranged in A-Z format for ease of access, World Monarchies and Dynasties includes information on major monarchs and dynasties from ancient time to the present. This set: includes overviews of reigns and successions, genealogical charts, and dynastic timelines; addresses concepts, problems, and theories of monarchy; provides background and information for further research; highlights important places, structures, symbols, events, and legends related to particular monarchs and dynasties; includes a master bibliography and multiple indexes.</p><p>Here is a source that attempts to "present monarchy as a central political and religious institution." There are close to 400 entries on those individual monarchs "whose reigns and actions significantly impacted history" and more than 450 on specific royal dynasties. Additionally, 140 subject-related entries cover broad concepts like accession, conquest, descent, and funerals. Entries cover various time periods and places and are arranged alphabetically, beginning with <i>Abbas the Great,</i> of the Persian Safavid dynasty, and ending with the <i>Zulu Kingdom of Africa.</i> Ranging overall from half a page to seven pages, most entries are less than a page long. Longer treatments are subdivided by topic or chronology. For example, Alexander the Great's entry contains the subheadings "Early Life," "Conquest Begins," and "Height of Empire." <p>A list of further reading is included at the end of most entries, usually citing from one to five sources. At times these resources seem insufficient--there is only one source for further reading after the entries on <i>Alexander the Great</i> and the <i>Roman Empire.</i>Sixteen maps are scattered across the three volumes, allowing readers to better visualize the Inca, Holy Roman, Byzantine, or Ottoman Empires, for example. Entries are supplemented by sidebars with tertiary tidbits of information, for example, "The Games and Shows of Augustus Caesar," "Indonesian Puppet Rituals," and "The Peacock Throne." The table of contents includes a helpful "List of Features," which groups the sidebars and other features under topics such as "Royal Places," "Royal Relatives," and "Royal Rituals." A four-page introduction briefly outlines the history and nature of monarchy, the concept of divine kings, royal blood, and the future of monarchy. A chronology extends from the first Egyptian dynasty, in 3100 B.C.E., to the present day. Charts (usually a chronological list of rulers or a family tree) and black-and-white photographs and illustrations are scattered throughout the volumes. Each volume contains a general and biographical index, and volume 3 includes a 20-page bibliography.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent resource for quick references on both famous and obscure rulers, kingdoms, and monarchical concepts. Recommended for public and academic libraries. <i>Michael Tosko</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i></p><i>Starred Review.</i> Grade 9 Up&#x2013;This is a unique and noteworthy contribution&#x2013;there is nothing else like it. It is thorough and comprehensive, and covers individual monarchs from all continents and historical periods; royal dynasties (families); kingdoms and nations; and topics such as oaths, polygamy, taxation, myth and folklore, cooks, and etiquette. Each volume contains both a general and biographical index; volume 1 includes a chronology and volume 3 a bibliography; many articles also cite further reading entries, which range in length from several paragraphs to several pages, consistently begin with a short definition, and are clear and readable. Black-and-white illustrations are scattered throughout and there are many maps. The set is not without flaws; there are a number of errors, spelling variations within entries, typos, incomplete see and see-also references, and repetition of entries (for instance, Old Testament kings are covered under Biblical Kings; Hebrew Kings; Israel, Kingdoms of; and Judah, Kingdom of). Overall, though, this set will be useful for schools with strong history departments and will provide many hours of fascinating reading for those intrigued by both its general and specific topics.<i>&#x2013;Ann W.

But though this is the work de Chirico is best known for, his Metaphysical Painting period lasted only until 1919, and he remained prolific and experimental throughout his entire long life (trying out, for example, a Return to Order and a Rubens-inspired neobaroque style). <br><br>In <i>Giorgio de Chirico: The Changing Face of Metaphysical Art</i>, the first de Chirico overview in more than 20 years, scholar Victoria Noel-Johnson explores the artist&#x2019;s entire, complex career and proposes a cohesive logic within its diversity. Organizing the artist&#x2019;s works thematically and reading them through the Nietzschean philosophy to which the artist was famously devoted, Noel-Johnson argues that despite de Chirico&#x2019;s many changes in style, technique, subject, composition and tone over the course of six decades, all of his works offer tangible visions of intangible philosophical concepts. <br><br>Richly illustrated, this volume features works drawn from the artist&#x2019;s foundation and some of the most prestigious museums and collections in Italy, presented alongside a rich core of archival documents including letters and period photographs. <br><br>Italian artist, writer and proto-surrealist <b>Giorgio de Chirico</b> (1888&#x2013;1978) began to develop his <i>Pittura Metafisica</i> after traveling in Milan, Florence and Turin between 1909 and 1911, where he was inspired by the bright Mediterranean light, sun-drenched piazzas and receding arcades&#x2015;elements that would become essential visual motifs in his best-known works.</p></p><p></p><h2>Manuka: The biography of an extraordinary honey</h2><p><p>New Zealand's manuka honey is known around the world.

Her strict mother worked hard at cultivating her own role as the long-suffering ex-wife of bad-boy poet Lord Byron while raising Ada in isolation. Tutored by the brightest minds, Ada developed a hunger for mental puzzles, mathematical conundrums, and scientific discovery that kept pace with the breathtaking advances of the industrial and social revolutions taking place in Europe. At seventeen, Ada met eccentric inventor Charles Babbage, a kindred spirit. Their ensuing collaborations resulted in ideas and concepts that presaged computer programming by almost two hundred years, and Ada Lovelace is now recognized as a pioneer and prophet of the information age. Award-winning author Emily Arnold McCully opens the window on a peculiar and singular intellect, shaped &#x2014; and hampered &#x2014; by history, social norms, and family dysfunction.

The case in point is the working-class Catholic resistance to British rule in Northern Ireland. During the 1970s women in Catholic/nationalist districts of Belfast organized themselves into street committees and led popular forms of resistance against the policies of the government of Northern Ireland and, after its demise, against those of the British. In the abundant literature on the conflict, however, the political tactics of nationalist women have passed virtually unnoticed. Bego�a Aretxaga argues here that these hitherto invisible practices were an integral part of the social dynamic of the conflict and had important implications for the broader organization of nationalist forms of resistance and gender relationships.</p><br><p> Combining interpretative anthropology and poststructuralist feminist theory, Aretxaga contributes not only to anthropology and feminist studies but also to research on ethnic and social conflict by showing the gendered constitution of political violence. She goes further than asserting that violence affects men and women differently by arguing that the manners in which violence is gendered are not fixed but constantly shifting, depending on the contingencies of history, social class, and ethnic identity. Thus any attempt at subverting gender inequality is necessarily colored by other dimensions of political experience.</p></p><p><p>"Begoa Aretxaga provides a forceful voice in ongoing debates, presenting ethnographically and historiographically the gendering of violence that has accompanied the civil war in Northern Ireland.... There is an integrity and passion in Aretxaga's analysis."--<b>Joan Vincent, Barnard College</b></p><b>Bego�a Aretxaga</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University.</p><h2>Harrisons Principles of Internal Medicine Self-Assessment and Board Review 18th Edition</h2><p><p><b>Add the unmatched authority of <i>Harrison&#x2019;s</i> to your board review or test preparation</b></p> <p><b><i>1,100 review questions!</i></b></p> <p>Based on the content of <i>Harrison&#x2019;s Principles of Internal Medicine, 18e</i>, this powerful study tool is essential for Internal Medicine Board certification or recertification/maintenance of certification, or as a refresher for any internal medicine examination.</p> <p>Reflecting the accuracy and timeliness of <i>Harrison&#x2019;s</i>, this complete review of internal medicine features more than 1,100 review questions, many of which utilize realistic patient scenarios, including radiographic or pathologic images.

The comprehensive cover reinforcement process will drastically combat wear and tear, keeping your favorite books in great condition for years to come! Turtleback books are ideal for any reader, or for use in schools or libraries.</p><p>Kurt Vonnegut's absurdist classic <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> introduces us to Billy Pilgrim, a man who becomes unstuck in time after he is abducted by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. In a plot-scrambling display of virtuosity, we follow Pilgrim simultaneously through all phases of his life, concentrating on his (and Vonnegut's) shattering experience as an American prisoner of war who witnesses the firebombing of Dresden. <p> Don't let the ease of reading fool you--Vonnegut's isn't a conventional, or simple, novel. He writes, "There are almost no characters in this story, and almost no dramatic confrontations, because most of the people in it are so sick, and so much the listless playthings of enormous forces. One of the main effects of war, after all, is that people are discouraged from being characters..." <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> (taken from the name of the building where the POWs were held) is not only Vonnegut's most powerful book, it is as important as any written since 1945. Like <i>Catch- 22</i>, it fashions the author's experiences in the Second World War into an eloquent and deeply funny plea against butchery in the service of authority. <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> boasts the same imagination, humanity, and gleeful appreciation of the absurd found in Vonnegut's other works, but the book's basis in rock-hard, tragic fact gives it a unique poignancy--and humor.</p><i>Slaughterhous-Five</i> is one of the world's great anti-war books. Centering on the infamous fire-bombing of Dresden, Billy Pilgrim's odyssey through time reflects the mythic journey of our own fractured lives as we search for meaning in what we are afraid to know.</p><h2>Semiotics and Thematics in Hermeneutics</h2><p>SEUNG, T.

E. Hotchner: King of the Hill and Looking for Miracles (Volume 1)</h2><p><p><i>King of the Hill</i> is A. E. Hotchner&#x2019;s memoir of his impoverished childhood in St. Louis, originally published in 1972. Hotchner&#x2019;s story is one of ingenuity and spirit in the face of economic hardship during the Great Depression. Left to live alone in a rundown hotel while his traveling salesman father is on the road, his mother is hospitalized, and his younger brother is sent to live with relatives, young Hotchner&#x2019;s determination to survive overcomes the challenge of keeping his situation secret.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Looking for Miracles</i> is a sequel to <i>King of the Hill</i>, originally published in 1975. The story takes place in 1936, three years after <i>King of the Hill</i>, when Hotchner bluffs his way into a job as a summer counselor at a camp in the Ozarks. The story is poignant and uplifting, as well as hilariously entertaining.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bound together for the first time, these two boyhood memoirs of Hotchner&#x2019;s will touch readers with their truth, innocence, and joy.

This large-format publication reveals his extensive body of sculptural work. Inspired by Kurt Schwitters, Giacometti and Surrealist object art, some of his early assemblages date back to the 1950s. These pieces are composed of everyday found objects, which Twombly arranged in the vein of magical or fetishistic objects. Later he began to cover them with a uniform coat of white paint. Thus placed in a new formal context, the original meaning of the individual pieces is blurred, connecting them with a wide range of cultural references. Literature and music, landscape and plantlife are all evoked. Twombly&#39;s sculptures are always white, exuding both an odd, ethereal quality and an aura of timeless poetry.</p><p>Born in 1928 in Lexington, Virginia, Twombly studied art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston the Art Students League, New York and Black Mountain College in North Carolina. In the mid 1950s, following travels in Europe and Africa, Twombly emerged as a prominent figure among a group of artists working in New York that included Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. In 1959, Twombly settled permanently in Italy. He has had numerous one-person exhibitions internationally and has been the subject of major retrospectives in both Europe and America. In 1995 the Cy Twombly Gallery, a collaboration of Dia Center for the Arts, the Menil Collection, Houston, and the artist, opened in Houston.</p><h2>To the Devil a Daughter (Tales of Mystery &amp; the Supernatural)</h2><p>With An Introduction by Anthony Lejeune <br> Why did the solitary girl leave her rented house on the French Riviera only for short walks at night? Why was she so frightened? Why did animals shrink away from her? The girl herself didn't know, and was certainly not aware of the terrible appointment which had been made for her long ago and was now drawing close. <br> Molly Fountain, the tough-minded Englishwoman living next door, was determined to find the answer. She sent for a wartime secret service colleague to come and help. What they discovered was horrifying beyond anything they could have imagined. <br> Dennis Wheatley returned in this book to his black magic theme which he had made so much his own with his famous best seller The Devil Rides Out. In the cumulative shock of its revelations, the use of arcane knowledge, the mounting suspense and acceleration to a fearful climax, he out-does even that earlier achievement. This is, by any standards, a terrific story.</p><p><b>Dennis Wheatley</b> (1897&#x2013;1977) was an English author whose prolific output of stylish thrillers and occult novels made him one of the world's best-selling writers from the 1930s through the 1960s.<p>&#x201c;One of the most popular storytellers of the century.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Daily Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;The greatest adventure writer of his time.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Daily Mail</i></p><p>&#x201c;He forcibly abducts the imagination.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Howard Spring, Evening Standard</i></p><p>&#x201c;The word thriller has never been more aptly bestowed.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lionel Hale, The News Chronicle</i></p></p><h2>Finish Carpentry: Efficient Techniques for Custom Interiors</h2><p><p>This step-by-step guide will help produce the highest quality work possible under typical time and budgetary constraints.

In this book, medieval historian Charles Wood brings these fascinating figures to life through an original combination of traditional biography and wide-ranging discussion of the political and social world in which they lived. Wood draws on a range of unusual sources--from art and legal codes to chronicles and lives of saints--to present a new picture of medieval people and their concerns. Focusing on topics often neglected by other historians, he includes lively discussions of royal adultery scandals, child-kings and the problems they posed, and earlier people and crises that helped to shape the culture of sex and sainthood that was profoundly that of the Middle Ages. In so doing, he clarifies the historical contributions of Richard and Joan, and sheds new light on the political, social, and religious forces that shaped medieval government and made France and England such widely different countries.<br></p><p>Medieval historian Charles Wood considers the larger than life figures Joan of Arc and Richard III, whose actions, both real and legendary, helped to shape the political character of their respective countries. Wood explores how France and England, governmentally so similar in the eleventh century, became so dissimilar by the fifteenth, with France&#39;s monarchy moving rapidly toward absolutism while England&#39;s was becoming more limited and representational. Wood argues that Joan of Arc and Richard III gave final medieval form to these developments, Joan by restoring the sanctity of the French crown through her divine mission, Richard by rendering legitimate the restraining role of Parliament. Focusing on topics often neglected by other historians, Wood includes lively discussions of royal adultery scandals, child-kings and the problems they posed, and earlier peoples and crisis that helped to shape the culture of sex and sainthood that was so profoundly that of the Middle Ages.Charles T.

Merrill Singer, a medical anthropologist involved in the public health impact of alcohol and illicit drug use, conducted interviews over a seven-year period with Tony, a street drug addict who grew up in the inner city. Tony learned the ways of using and selling drugs from his father, became an enforcer in a street gang, spent considerable time in prison, committed seemingly heartless, violent acts, and has had to struggle with the knowledge that he suffers from HIV infection. Tony's life story is an insider, personal view of a tumultuous, marginalized world that intertwines closely with the wider social milieu constructed and sustained by the U.S. political economy. Unique to this book is its attempt to understand the forces that contribute to the risky behavior of drug use, even at a time when drug users know about its deadly and damaging connection to diseases like HIV and hepatitis. Tony's story demonstrates that none of us make choices in a vacuum. Further, the book addresses important issues about how structures of social inequality in our society impact the lives and options of those at the bottom of the social ladder.<p>Also by Merrill Singer and available from Waveland Press: <i>Drugging the Poor: Legal and Illegal Drugs and Social Inequality</i> (ISBN 9781577664949); <i>Drugs and Development: The Global Impact on Sustainable Growth and Human Rights</i> (ISBN 9781577665724); and <i>Something Dangerous: Emergent and Changing Illicit Drug Use and Community Health</i> (ISBN 9781577663768).

These scientists collected over 78,000 specimens during their time on the islands, validating the work of Charles Darwin and laying the groundwork for foundational evolution texts like <em>Darwin's Finches</em>. Despite its significance, almost nothing has been written on this voyage, lost amongst discussion of Darwin's trip on the Beagle and the writing of David Lack.<br><br>In <em>Collecting Evolution</em>, author Matthew James finally tells the story of the 1905 Galapagos expedition. James follows these eight young men aboard the <em>Academy</em> to the Galapagos and back, and reveals the reasons behind the groundbreaking success they had. A current Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, James uses his access to unpublished writings and photographs to provide unprecedented insight into the expedition. We learn the voyagers' personal stories, and how, for all the scientific progress that was made, just as much intense personal drama unfolded on the trip. This book shares a watershed moment in scientific history, crossed with a maritime adventure. There are four tangential suicides and controversies over credit and fame. <em>Collecting Evolution</em> also explores the personal lives and scientific context that preceded this voyage, including what brought Darwin to the Galapagos on the Beagle voyage seventy years earlier. James discusses how these men thought of themselves as "collectors" before they thought of themselves as scientists, and the implications this had on their approach and their results.<br><br>In the end, the voyage of the <em>Academy</em> proved to be crucial in the development of evolutionary science as we know it. It is the longest expedition in Galapagos history, and played a critical role in cementing Darwin's legacy. <em>Collecting Evolution</em> brings this extraordinary story of eight scientists and their journey to life.<br></p><p><br>Matthew James is a Fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, and Professor of Geology and Paleontology at Sonoma State University. He has been writing about the Galapagos in historical, scientific, and research capacities for over thirty years.<br><br>"The author's focus upon the activities of the young collectors lends an attractive sense of concreteness to his narrative. He leaves no reason to doubt that collecting in the field can be difficult, dangerous, and exhausting work, amid vomit, bed bugs, and swamping boats." -- Michael T. Ghiselin, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"James's study is a lucid, often lively, contribution to an episode in the annals of evolution that is less well known than perhaps it should be. The book benefits from the author's extensive utilization of the diaries, field notes, journals, photographs, and correspondence of the eight biologists aboard Academy." -- Professor Martin Fichman, <em>Isis Journal</em><p></p><br>"For readers, Charles Darwin, born in 1809, apparently never gets old... Currently we get about 160 a year - a Darwin tome every 2.3 days. Even with a book population so large, most years bring notable additions, and so it is in 2017... the geologist Matthew J. James's <em>Collecting Evolution</em> recounts a 1905-6 Galapagos visit in which the legendary field naturalist Rollo Beck, wielding shotgun, burlap bags and camera, made observations that provided crucial support for Darwin's work in those islands." -- <em>New York Times Book Review, 18 September 2017</em><p></p><br>"James writes well and delivers a stimulating account of evolutionary thought through the years" -- <em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"An excellent read on the last collection voyage to Galapagos" -- <em>Galapagos Matters</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Traditional Magic Spells for Protection and Healing</h2><p>An in-depth collection of ancient spells and magic practices drawn from rare and newly discovered texts <br><br>� Presents more than 600 magical prescriptions for healing and protection from both pagan and Christian sources <br><br>� Examines the practice of diagnosing illness through magic and explores ancient beliefs about curses and other evil spells and about devils, demons, and ghosts <br><br>� Includes spells from the heavily guarded gypsy tradition of magic and healing, drawn from newly discovered materials <br><br>Since the beginning of history, people have sought remedies for the many ills that have beset them, from illnesses afflicting the body to threats posed by evil and hostile individuals. In many folk healing and pagan traditions, it was believed that one must gain the assistance of the guardian spirit of a healing plant or substance through prayers or offerings before its chemical properties would be effective. The Church decried these spells and practices as pagan superstition but did not seek to exterminate these beliefs, instead transferring the responsibility for their healing powers to the apostles and saints. <br><br>Drawing on his extensive knowledge of ancient texts, Claude Lecouteux presents more than 600 magical prescriptions from both pagan and Christian sources from the last 2,000 years, covering everything from abscesses and shingles to curses and healing animals. He examines the practice of diagnosing illness through magic and looks at the origins of disease according to the evolving beliefs of magic practitioners over the centuries. He explores ancient beliefs about curses and about devils, demons, and ghosts and provides an in-depth look at protection magic, including protection of health, animals, and cultivated land, protection against curses, witchcraft, bad weather, and beasts, protection of a home, and protection while traveling. He includes spells from the heavily guarded gypsy tradition of magic and healing, drawn from newly discovered materials collected by two Romanian ethnologists who lived and traveled with gypsies in Transylvania in the mid-19th century. The author also reproduces rare texts on magic healing from the 14th and 15th centuries. <br><br>Revealing the vitality of these practices in the remoter areas of Eastern Europe, Lecouteux shows how the influence of this pagan worldview is still detectable in the work of modern folk healers in France and Scandinavia. He also shows how the condemnation of unorthodox methods of healing has not vanished from the contemporary world: the medieval legislation against healing by wizards and bonesetters is echoed in modern health codes that challenge the authority of naturopaths and faith healers.</p><p>Claude Lecouteux is a former professor of medieval literature and civilization at the Sorbonne. He is the author of numerous books on medieval and pagan afterlife beliefs and magic, including <i>The Book of Grimoires</i>, <i>Dictionary of Ancient Magic Words and Spells</i>, and <i>The Tradition of Household Spirits</i>. He lives in Paris.<b>Chapter Seven</b> <br><b><br>Protections</b> <br><br>Magical protection essentially assumes two forms in our accounts: prayer or amulet. Every time there is a recommendation to carry or wear something on your person, the mental process conforms with the etymology of the word &#x201c;amulet,&#x201d; which comes from the verb amoliri, &#x201c;to ward off, to protect.&#x201d; The object--plant, mineral, artifact--is a phylactery to which is attributed a preventive virtue against illnesses, afflictions, accidents, and evil spells. People seek protection--when starting a journey by land or sea and when staying at home--against anything that could possibly befall them. <br><br>HDA, VII, 1611-16 (Reisesegen); E.

They have chronicled language, madness, gender, and sexuality and have experimented with new forms of presentation. They have turned to the histories of non-Western peoples and to the troubled relations between &#x201c;the West&#x201d; and the rest. Allan Megill welcomes these developments, but he also suggests that there is now confusion among historians about what counts as a justified account of the past.<br> <br> In <i>Historical Knowledge, Historical Error</i>, Megill dispels some of the confusion. Here, he discusses issues of narrative, objectivity, and memory. He attacks what he sees as irresponsible uses of evidence while accepting the art of speculation, which incomplete evidence forces upon historians. Along the way, he offers succinct accounts of the epistemological road historians have traveled from Herodotus and Thucydides through Leopold von Ranke and Alexis de Tocqueville, and on to Hayden White, Natalie Zemon Davis, and Lynn Hunt.</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><p><b>Allan Megill</b> is professor of history at the University of Virginia. He is the author of<i>Prophets of Extremity:<b></b>Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida</i> and <i>Karl Marx: The Burden of Reason (Why Marx Rejected Politics and the Market), </i>and editor of <i>Rethinking Objectivity.</i></p><p><i></i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Historical Knowledge, Historical Error</i> is part of a resurgence of interest in the philosophy of history. Allan Megill knows his history and is more than usually sophisticated as a philosopher. He has useful and wise things to say on a host of topics including memory, counterfactuals, narrative, and professionalization. By no means do I agree with all&nbsp;that Megill has argued, but he is intelligent, clear, and displays a scholarly integrity that is rock-solid. The book deserves our extended attention.&#x201d;--Bruce Kuklick, University of Pennsylvania</p> (Bruce Kuklick 2006-09-28)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Megill&#x2019;s book represents a major and much-needed intervention in the debates that have engaged historians and philosophers of history in the last two or three decades. Coming from someone who has thought deeply, carefully, and long on the meanings of historical objectivity for our times, this is a book that presents a fresh and clear point of view. Megill&#x2019;s argument deserves attention from everybody who wonders about where the discipline of history might be headed once the dust has settled on the tired debates over objectivity versus relativist skepticism.&#x201d;--Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago</p>&nbsp; (Dipesh Chakrabarty 2006-09-28)<br><br>"With this rigorous and lucid work, Megill has made a major contribution to the understanding of historical thought. . . . In brief, this is a work of exceptional value. Essential."

(John L. Harvey <i>H-France</i>)<br><br>"This is a rewarding book. In ten essays, Allan Megill explores some of the most pressing challenges and worrisome pitfalls in modern historical practice. . . . These challenging and stimulating essays succeed well . . .&nbsp;in affirming that history works best when it is sharply distinguished from the present. Indeed, by remaining true to its core disciplinary methods and ideals, history can serve, Megill movingly concludes, 'as a model of honesty and intelligence in the investigation of the human world.'" (Christopher Layne <i>Journal of American History</i> 2007-12-01)<br><br>"Demanding intellectual rigor, Megill re-defines familiar terms and interjects his own firm opinions, leading readers along a circuitous path through the brambles of his own impressive learning. Readers can only trail along after this insightful and candid guide as he provocatively cites noted philosophers and historians, chastising them for solecisms. . . . To read his essays is like auditing a bracing seminar conducted by a stimulating, opinionated teacher." (Raymond Grew <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>)<br><br>"This is an engaged book: it energetically attempts to provide 'a contemporary guide to practice,' to ward off historical error by the discriminating constitution of historical knowledge. At the heart of the book is Megill's long-standing engagement with the concept of 'objectivity,' and his effort to reconstitute the notion in terms of its many and nested significations." (John H.

Over the course of his thirty-year career, Williams (b. 1956) has crafted photographs that engage&#x2014;often through uncanny mimicry&#x2014;the conventions of photojournalism, picture archives, and commercial imagery, as well as their sociopolitical contexts and implications. The book includes a trio of essays by curators Mark Godfrey, Roxana Marcoci, and Matthew S. Witkovsky, which explore Williams&#x2019;s engagement with his artistic peers and predecessors, with cinema (particularly the film-essay), and with the methods and modes of display and publicity in the art world, in addition to a transcript of a talk Williams delivered on the work of John Chamberlain. These more conventional contributions are &#x201c;interrupted&#x201d; by additional historical and contemporary textual and visual materials that were selected by the artist himself and are occasionally presented in facsimile form.

This edition has detailed notes and a new introduction which discusses the originality and subtlety of the book's angle on women's experience. Also included in this edition is the sequel to <em>Cranford</em>, <em>The Cage at Cranford</em>, and a unique appendix of related writing.</p><p>Originally published as a magazine serial and then printed in novel form in 1853, Cranford is a playful tour of a peculiar country town. From the stately, stern Miss Jenkyns to the timid Miss Betsy Barker and her flannel-wearing cow, the inhabitants are all acquainted, and all poised to overhear scandal.<p> Elizabeth Gaskell&#x2019;s episodic second novel, sometimes dismissed as nostalgically &#x201c;charming,&#x201d; is now considered by many critics to be her most sophisticated work. The country town of Cranford is home to a group of women, affectionately called &#x201c;Amazons&#x201d; by the narrator, whose seemingly uneventful lives are full of conflicts, failures, and unexpected connections. A rich commentary on Victorian culture by one of its most astute observers, <em>Cranford </em>owes its enduring popularity to the complex pleasures it offers the reader. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition provides an assortment of historical materials to put the novel in context, including Gaskell&#x2019;s letters from the period of the novel&#x2019;s writing, excerpts from texts read by the characters, illustrations from the novel and from contemporary periodicals, and other Victorian writings on industrialization, etiquette, and domestic life. </p></p><h2>Fact and Artifact: Writing Nonfiction (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p>Focuses on the kinds of nonfiction writing that real writers do: writing about people, places, performace, how-to, science, humor, controversy.

These processes are derived from the way real writers actually write; they are flexible and versatile so that they can be adapted to individual emphasis and aims. In addition, the book devotes separate chapters to the types of nonfiction most commonly written and published: writing about people, places, performance, humor, processes, science, and controversy.</p><h2>Barbed-Wire Imperialism: Britain&#39;s Empire of Camps, 1876-1903 (Volume 12) (Berkeley Series in British Studies)</h2><p>Camps are emblems of the modern world, but they first appeared under the imperial tutelage of Victorian Britain. Comparative and transnational in scope,&nbsp;<i>Barbed-Wire Imperialism</i>&nbsp;situates the concentration and refugee camps of the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) within longer traditions of controlling the urban poor in metropolitan Britain and managing "suspect" populations in the empire. Workhouses and prisons, along with criminal tribe settlements and enclosures for the millions of Indians displaced by famine and plague in the late nineteenth century, offered early prototypes for mass encampment. Venues of great human suffering, British camps were artifacts of liberal empire that inspired&nbsp;and legitimized the practices of future regimes.</p><p>"This book is highly original, timely, and overdue in the best sense of that word. No one has undertaken to show how and why the concentration camp as a form and as an ideology emerged as a constituent part of imperial governance. As with all good histories that begin by examining phenomena cloaked in 'state of exception' arguments, this one reveals the commonplace character of camps in several, often linked, spaces of imperial dominion and settlement."&#x2014;Antoinette Burton, author of <i>The&nbsp;</i><i>Trouble with Empire: Challenges to Modern British Imperialism</i><br><br> "This important book foregrounds the importance of violence, confinement, and coercion in Britain&#x2019;s Victorian empire. Through a meticulously detailed, comparative study, Aidan Forth restores to history the lives and worlds of the ten million colonized subjects who were interned in famine, plague, and concentration camps across British India and South Africa. Turning on the concept of the &#x2018;disaster imperialism&#x2019; of famine, plague, and war, <i>Barbed-Wire Imperialism</i> confronts key concerns of global and imperial history: transfers of power and knowledge, trans-imperial connections, governance and governmentality, and liberalism and empire. It also creates a useable past that is of vital relevance in the world today."&#x2014;Clare Anderson, author of <i>Subaltern Lives: Biographies of Colonialism in the Indian Ocean World, 1790-1920</i><br><br> "<i>Barbed-Wire Imperialism</i> is a model study of biopolitical governance, but it goes far beyond the usual case studies of biopolitical institutions to make connections between metropolitan workhouse discipline, India&#x2019;s famine camps, and Boer War concentration camps. Well written and compelling, bold in scope yet nuanced in analysis, Forth&#x2019;s study changes our understanding of the British Empire."&#x2014;Anna Clark, author of <i>Alternative Histories of the Self: A Cultural History of Sexuality and Secrets</i><br><br> "Aidan&nbsp;Forth's study takes us further in the pursuit of understanding the history of the British camps of famine, plague, and the Anglo-Boer War (Britain's nineteenth-century 'empire of camps'), and in a fascinating way opens up new avenues of research on a sensitive topic.&#x2014;Fransjohan Pretorius<i>, </i>author of&nbsp;<i>A to Z of the Anglo-Boer War</i><br><br> "Responses to war, plague, and famine come under critical scrutiny in Aidan Forth's insightful and innovative investigation of civilian confinement camps in high imperial India and South Africa. In tracing crucial lines of connectivity across the Indian Ocean, Forth sheds fresh light on imperial biopolitics, state coercion and sanitary expertise, the control of 'dangerous bodies,' and suffering and colonial subjects. At the same time, by showing the constraints on imperial excess and questioning the presumed legacies of imperial concentration camps, he revalidates the concept of 'liberal empire.' Assiduous research and attention to detail allied to recognition of global trends make this empire history at its most compelling."&#x2014;David Arnold<i>, </i>Professor Emeritus University of Warwick<br> &nbsp;<b>Aidan Forth</b> is Assistant Professor of History at MacEwan University.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Ghostly Register</h2><p><p>A traveler's guide to America's strangest landmarks, including haunted dwellings and active spirits.</p></p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>The Emotional Construction of Morals</h2><p>Jesse Prinz argues that recent work in philosophy, neuroscience, and anthropology supports two radical hypotheses about the nature of morality: moral values are based on emotional responses, and these emotional responses are inculcated by culture, not hard-wired through natural selection. In the first half of the book, Jesse Prinz defends the hypothesis that morality has an emotional foundation. Evidence from brain imaging, social psychology, and psychopathology suggest that, when we judge something to be right or wrong, we are merely expressing our emotions. Prinz argues that these emotions do not track objective features of reality; rather, the rightness and wrongness of an act consists in the fact that people are disposed to have certain emotions towards it. In the second half of the book, he turns to a defense of moral relativism. Moral facts depend on emotional responses, and emotional responses vary from culture to culture. Prinz surveys the anthropological record to establish moral variation, and he draws on cultural history to show how attitudes toward practices such as cannibalism and marriage change over time. He also criticizes evidence from animal behavior and child development that has been taken to support the claim that moral attitudes are hard-wired by natural selection. Prinz concludes that there is no single true morality, but he also argues that some moral values are better than others; moral progress is possible. Throughout the book, Prinz relates his views to contemporary and historical work in philosophical ethics. His views echo themes in the writings of David Hume and Friedrich Nietzsche, but Prinz supports, extends, and revises these classic theories using the resources of cutting-edge cognitive science. The Emotional Construction of Morals will stimulate and challenge anyone who is curious about the nature and origin of moral values.</p><p><br><strong>Jesse Prinz</strong> is John J. Rogers Professor of Philosophy at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.<br><br>"Prinz's intellectual enterprise is of truly classical proportions...[his] work is certainly original and deserves all praise for bridging so many gaps between intellectual communities."--<em>Metapsychology Online Review</em><p></p><br>"There is much to like about Prinz's arguments throughout the book, and they need <br>to be taken seriously by subjectivists and objectivists alike... Prinz's arguments are compelling, ingenious, and hard to refute. Sentimentalists would be richly rewarded by taking his arguments into account." -- <em>Philosophical Psychology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Miniature Guide to Critical Thinking Concepts &amp; Tools (Thinker's Guide Library)</h2><p>This powerful book introduces core critical thinking concepts and principles as an empowering problem-solving framework for every profession, course of study, and indeed every area of life.

Can you explain why the product of two fractions between 0 and 1 is less than either factor? How are rational numbers related to irrational numbers, which your students will study in later grades?<br>How much do you know... and how much do you need to know?<br><br>Helping your upper elementary school students develop a robust understanding of rational numbers requires that you understand this mathematics deeply. But what does that mean?<br><br>This book focuses on essential knowledge for teachers about rational numbers. It is organized around four big ideas, supported by multiple smaller, interconnected ideas essential understandings. Taking you beyond a simple introduction to rational numbers, the book will broaden and deepen your mathematical understanding of one of the most challenging topics for students and teachers. It will help you engage your students, anticipate their perplexities, avoid pitfalls, and dispel misconceptions. You will also learn to develop appropriate tasks, techniques, and tools for assessing students understanding of the topic.<br><br>Focus on the ideas that you need to understand thoroughly to teach confidently.</p><p></p><h2>The Chicago Tribune Tower Competition: Skyscraper Design and Cultural Change in the 1920s</h2><p>In 1922, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> sponsored an international competition to design its new corporate headquarters. Both a serious design contest and a brilliant publicity stunt, the competition received worldwide attention for the hundreds of submissions&#x2014;from the sublime to the ridiculous&#x2014;it garnered.<br><br>In this lavishly illustrated book, Katherine Solomonson tells the fascinating story of the competition, the diverse architectural designs it attracted, and its lasting impact. She shows how the <i>Tribune</i> used the competition to position itself as a civic institution whose new headquarters would serve as a defining public monument for Chicago. For architects, planners, and others, the competition sparked influential debates over the design and social functions of skyscrapers. It also played a crucial role in the development of advertising, consumer culture, and a new national identity in the turbulent years after World War I.<br></p><p>The Chicago Tribune Tower competition was one of the largest and most controversial design contests of the 1920s. This book demonstrates how the 263 competing entries helped change concepts of the skyscraper, engaged with conflicts of national identity, and shaped a newspaper&#39;s efforts to produce a civic and corporate icon.<b>Katherine Solomonson</b> is an associate professor of architecture and co-head of the Department of Architecture at the University of Minnesota's College of Architecture and Landscape Architecture.</p><h2>Veronese</h2><p>Paolo Veronese (1528&#x2013;1588) was one of the great Venetian artists of the Renaissance, whose works were admired for their rich colors and mastery of theatrical narrative. His paintings ranged from decorative fresco schemes and portraits to allegorical, biblical, and historical subjects, produced for an aristocratic international audience.<br>&nbsp;<br>This definitive reappraisal of the artist also provides a fascinating account of painting and patronage in 16th-century Venice. Xavier F. Salomon traces Veronese&#x2019;s career from its beginnings in Verona, where he developed an art shaped by the rediscovery of antiquity, to Venice, where he established a successful workshop. Salomon&#x2019;s discussion of Veronese&#x2019;s entire output, including his monumental banquet scenes, illuminates the original function of every work, many of them designed for specific locations. Generous illustrations, including numerous details, reveal the distinctive tactile qualities of Veronese&#x2019;s technique and the beauty of his palette, whether rendering rich textiles, precious metals or female complexions. &nbsp;This splendid book makes a significant contribution to scholarship in the field of 16th-century Venetian painting.<br></p><p>This splendid book reassesses the career of Veronese, one of the great artists of the Renaissance, and advances scholarship in the field of 16th-century Venetian painting.<br><b>Xavier F.

Anti-Indianism in Modern America tells the other side of stories of historical massacres and modern-day hate crimes, events that are dismissed or glossed over by historians, journalists, and courts alike. Cook-Lynn exposes the colonialism that works both overtly and covertly to silence and diminish Native Americans, supported by a rhetoric of reconciliation, assimilation, and multiculturalism. Comparing anti-Indianism to anti-Semitism, she sets the American history of broken treaties, stolen lands, mass murder, cultural dispossession, and Indian hating in an international context of ethnic cleansing, "ecocide" (environmental destruction), and colonial oppression. <p>Cook-Lynn also discusses the role Native American studies should take in reasserting tribal literatures, traditions, and politics and shows how the discipline has been sidelined by anthropology, sociology, postcolonial studies, and ethnic studies. Asserting the importance of a "native conscience"--a knowledge of the mythologies, mores, and experiences of tribal society--among American Indian writers, she calls for the expression in American Indian art and literature of a tribal consciousness that acts to assure a tribal-nation people of its future. </p><p>Passionate, eloquent, and uncompromising, Anti-Indianism in Modern America concludes that there are no real solutions for Indians as long as they remain colonized peoples. Native Americans must be able to tell their own stories and, most important, regain their land, the source of religion, morality, rights, and nationhood. As long as public silence accompanies the outlaw maneuvers that undermine tribal autonomy, the racist strategies that affect all Americans will continue. </p><p>It is difficult, Cook-Lynn concedes, to work toward the development of legal mechanisms against hate crimes, in Indian Country and elsewhere in the world. But it is not too late.</p></p><p>Elizabeth Cook-Lynn, a member of the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, is a writer, poet, and professor emerita of Native American studies at Eastern Washington University. She lives in Rapid City, South Dakota. Her books include <i>The Politics of Hallowed Ground</i> (coauthored with Mario Gonzalez), and <i>Aurelia, a Trilogy.</i>&#34;Reflects on the themes of nationalism, anti-Indianism, and genocide denial through a number of rhetorical forms: essays, speeches, letters, and a collection of diary entries... [Cook-Lynn&#39;s] emphasis on issues of nationhood, and the land attached to it, distinguishes her writings...

Mancall (Deadly Medicine: Indians &amp; Alcohol in Early America) and Merrell (Into the American Woods: Negotiators on the Pennsylvania Frontier) have edited a collection of 25 outstanding articles drawn mostly from journals such as Ethnohistory, William &amp; Mary Quarterly, and American Indian Culture and Research Journal. While not interrelated, the articles provide insight into various contact points throughout North America. Articles such as Theda Perdue's "Cherokee Women and the Trial of Tears" and Helen Tanner's "The Glaze in 1792: A Composite Indian Community" are especially noteworthy as they provide insight into aspects of the Native American experience that is often ignored.

They marched forward, ignoring the slack-jawed townspeople gaping at the banner they carried: a dragon with a forest curled within its talon, the emblem of the royal house. A palanquin draped in scarlet silk appeared, resting on the shoulders of four men. People craned their necks to see the occu�pant, but caught only a tantalizing glimpse through the swaying curtain: blood-red lips, golden blossoms in shining hair, and robes that cost more than any of them would see in a lifetime. <br><br>&#x201c;Another day, another concubine.&#x201d; A bent old woman bared the three teeth she had left. &#x201c;It seems he has a taste for pretty village girls. May blessings rain down upon him,&#x201d; she added hastily, in case a soldier heard her criticize their sovereign. <br><br>&#x201c;He must not discriminate by class when it comes to beauty,&#x201d; another woman agreed. She was not as old as the first, but she was just as bent. Most of her weight rested on her good leg, while the other hung crookedly, like a dead branch. Her shrewd gaze moved from the pro�cession to the girl beside her.<br><br>She was not the only one looking at this girl. More than one soldier admired her as he marched by.<br><br>The girl wore tattered, faded clothing like everyone else. But she had a face like a painting: a perfect oval, with lotus lips blooming beneath a sweet stem of a nose. She appeared docile, virginal, but the eyes she lifted told a different story with their sparkle of intelligence. They were the kind of eyes that flashed from the shadows of a darkened room.<br><br>&#x201c;He must not discriminate,&#x201d; the woman said again. &#x201c;What do you say to that, Xifeng?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wish the Emperor joy, Guma. She must be special indeed if he chose her for his own,&#x201d; the girl said respectfully, even as her coal-black eyes burned.<br><br>At the palace, slaves would bathe the young concubine&#x2019;s feet in orange flower water. Every inch of her would smell like jasmine, and when the Emperor put his lips on her skin, he would know nothing of her hardship and poverty&#x2014;the same hardship and poverty that coated Xifeng like sweat.<br><br>&#x201c;She is no more special than you.&#x201d; There was no love in Guma&#x2019;s statement, just fact. But they were mere words, ones she had said for years. She shuffled closer and hooked a claw-like hand around Xifeng&#x2019;s elbow. &#x201c;Come. It may be silks and riches for <i>her, </i>but it&#x2019;s back to the needles for us. Tonight, we will read the cards again,&#x201d; she added as gently as she ever could.<br><br>Xifeng knew these rare glimpses of kindness from her aunt could be swept away the next minute by a dark mood. So she inclined her head in a show of grateful obedience, picking up the basket containing their meager purchases, and the pair trudged back home.<br><br>They lived a short distance from the center of town&#x2014;rather a grand term for a muddy square. There, ragged farmers and crones with more brains than teeth hawked wares that had seen better days: maggoty vegetables, cracked pottery, dull knives, and cheap hemp fabric.<br><br>It had rained the night before, a torrential downpour of early spring that would be good for the rice and crops but had turned all else into a pungent soup of mud and debris. A few scrawny chickens ran by, a trail of droppings streaking behind them, as a woman emerged from a soggy cottage to scream at her brats.<br><br>Some days, Xifeng thought she would gladly watch this town burn. She ached to leave it all behind and never look back. To think she was trapped here forever, while the Imperial palanquin carried that other girl straight into the Emperor&#x2019;s swan-feathered bed.<br><br>She felt Guma&#x2019;s sharp eyes on her and took care to keep her face neutral. To show discontent was to rebuke her aunt for all the sacrifices she had made. After all, Guma had not been required to raise the bas�tard daughter of a sister who had shamed their family and killed herself. And despite being eighteen, Xifeng knew any small sign of displeasure would earn her a dozen stripes with the bamboo cane. She flinched inwardly, thinking of the scars on her back that had just begun to heal.<br><br>And then there he was, walking toward them, as though her thoughts had conjured him.<br><br>Wei. The reason for those scars.<br><br>His proud, shaven head was turned away, watching the innkeeper across the street argue with a customer. His features were sharper in profile, brutal and beautiful, and the other men gave him a wide berth as he cut through the crowd. With his shoulders like a bull, bare arms that rippled with muscle, and ferocious storm of a gaze, he was the living embodiment of war. But those large, capable hands, which now carried a stack of rusted swords to be repaired&#x2014;Xifeng knew how gen�tle they could be. She remembered how they had felt on her skin and struggled not to shiver at the memory of it, because Guma&#x2019;s clever eyes were still watching to see her reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;What would you like for supper?&#x201d; Xifeng kept her voice steady, as though she didn&#x2019;t know the man approaching them at all.<br><br>Wei faced forward. He had noticed them now; her skin prickled with his awareness. She wondered if he would say something. He had an idea that because he was physically strong and Guma weak, he could overpower her and free Xifeng from her control forever. But there were different kinds of strength, and provoking Guma to release hers was the last thing they would want.<br><br>She patted her aunt&#x2019;s tense arm as though there were no one else dearer to her in the world. &#x201c;I could make a soup of these prawns. Or I could fry the turnips, if you prefer.&#x201d;<br><br>And then the moment passed. Wei walked by without a word. Xifeng reserved her sigh of relief to release later when she was in the kitchen, alone.<br><br>&#x201c;Do the prawns,&#x201d; Guma said calmly. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re already beginning to smell.&#x201d;<br><br>A few steps more, and they arrived home.<br><br>Xifeng&#x2019;s grandparents had once owned the entire building with its handsome dark oak fa�ade and imposing doors carved with a phoenix rising. They had been successful tailors before the war, and Guma and her younger sister, Mingzhu, had grown up here. Xifeng found it more difficult to imagine Guma as a child than to picture the splendor that had long worn off these faded walls.<br><br>Despite the poor condition of the place, they had managed to rent the downstairs to a couple as a teahouse. Guma and Xifeng lived on the drafty upper floors with Ning, the girl they had hired to help them sew and embroider. She was waiting for them by the door, and though she was fifteen and scrawny, the glance she gave Wei&#x2019;s hard, retreating back was that of a woman. It was not the first time Xifeng had caught her gawking at him, but she had never seen the girl&#x2019;s longing so raw and sharp. She could practically feel the waves of lust radiating off her.<br><br>Xifeng felt something growl deep inside.<br><br>But before she could do or say anything, Guma released her arm and cracked a vicious slap across Ning&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;What are you doing there? I don&#x2019;t pay you to stand idling and ogling,&#x201d; she snapped as the girl touched her reddened cheek and sniffled. &#x201c;Get back upstairs.&#x201d;<br><br>Ning turned wet eyes to Xifeng before obeying, and though a note of pity rose up inside Xifeng, she remained silent. She knew that slap had been meant for <i>her, </i>but she had hidden her emotions so well that Guma had to vent her violence on the hired girl, like a teapot with built-up steam. She watched Ning slouch upstairs, both feeling sorry for her and thinking she deserved it if she thought she could steal Wei for herself.<br><br>But Xifeng&#x2019;s relief was short-lived. Guma grasped her arm again, pinching hard enough to leave a bruise. Her face had begun to wrin�kle like a rotting pear, making her appear much older than her forty years. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I don&#x2019;t know you want the same thing from him,&#x201d; she hissed, her sour breath filling Xifeng&#x2019;s nostrils. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think I don&#x2019;t know you still sneak around, no matter how many times I pull out that cane.&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng kept her eyes down, biting the inside of her cheek at the pain of Guma&#x2019;s fingernails, hatred boiling within her. No matter how hard she worked and how obediently she behaved, she received only scorn and beatings in return.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not good enough for you, do you understand? You deserve better.&#x201d; And though one hand still gripped Xifeng&#x2019;s arm, the other gently stroked her cheek.<br><br>That simple gesture, one a mother might make toward her daughter, dissolved the hatred in an instant. Xifeng leaned into her touch, forget�ting the pain.<br><br>&#x201c;Now help me upstairs, child.&#x201d;<br><br>The upper level had always seemed an endless labyrinth to Xifeng, even now as a grown woman. Once, these chambers had been full of purpose. Dried flowers still littered the floor of one room, where years ago they had hung from the rafters above vats of boiling water, ready to be made into fabric dyes. Across the hall, wisps of thread still clung to abandoned looms, unwilling to relinquish the past. The large room at the back had housed an army of hired girls, whose quick, clever hands had embroidered endless lengths of silk for noblewomen.<br><br>But those days were long gone. Nowadays, they used only four rooms: two for sleeping, one for cooking, and one for eating and sew�ing. She led Guma to a stool in this last room, where Ning sulked and hemmed a square of cotton with blue-dyed thread.<br><br>&#x201c;Mind your stitches,&#x201d; Xifeng told her, earning a baleful glare.<br><br>Ning had come from one of the coastal villages, reeking of fish and poverty. Guma had hired her when she saw what she could do with a needle. Since then, the girl had become Xifeng&#x2019;s shadow, the irritating younger sister she&#x2019;d never had. Ning followed her, asking questions and imitating her movements, the way she spoke, and the style in which she arranged her hair. But there was a sense of competition, too, and Xifeng suspected the girl&#x2019;s interests had shifted from trying to impress Guma to making Wei look at her the way he looked at Xifeng.<br><br>Ning darted a frightened glance at her, and Xifeng realized she had been staring. She turned away, draping a length of pale pink silk over Guma&#x2019;s lap.<br><br>For weeks, they had been embroidering plum blossoms all over the fabric. Her aunt had sneered at the choice of color and design, which belied the humble origins of the lady who had commissioned the tunic for a banquet. Truly well-bred women preferred silks dyed darker col�ors, which cost more. But Xifeng thought wistfully that she would wear the cheapest of silks if it meant she too could enjoy herself at some festival.<br><br>&#x201c;Go prepare the meal, and don&#x2019;t be long about it,&#x201d; Guma told her crossly. &#x201c;We need to finish this in two days, and you&#x2019;ve wasted too much time gawking at the new concubine.&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng held her tongue at this injustice. It was Guma who had want�ed to wait for the procession on this chilly spring morning, so she could compare her niece with the new addition to the Imperial harem.<br><br>&#x201c;Was she beautiful?&#x201d; Ning asked timidly.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Guma snapped, though she hadn&#x2019;t seen any more of the woman than anyone else. <br>&#x201c;Do you think the Emperor would choose an ugly girl like you to bear his children?&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng turned to hide her smile and carried the basket down the hall. Guma was right. Wei would <i>never </i>look at such a plain, moon-faced girl. Not when he had <i>her.</i><br> <i><br>But Ning didn&#x2019;t choose to look the way she does, </i>Xifeng thought, with another twinge of pity. <i>Any more than I did. </i>She put a pot of water on to boil, gazing at her own reflection.<br><br>She had seen that face every day for eighteen years in the wash�basin. She never needed to open her mouth. She never needed to do much. All it took was stepping out with that face, and she would get a wink from the innkeeper, the best cut of meat from the butcher, and a pretty bead or two from the tradesmen in the square. One of them had even given her a pomegranate once. Wei had been furious when she told him, and would have made her throw it away if she hadn&#x2019;t already brought it home to Guma.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t ask for these things,&#x201d; she had protested, comparing it to his natural-born talent for metalworking. The town craftsman had hired him because he could shape a beautiful sword from the ugliest bronze. But still, Wei had been gruff and grim and unwilling to understand.<br><br>Perhaps the Emperor&#x2019;s new concubine had been born with a face like hers. Lovelier, even, since it had won her a home in the Imperial Palace.<br><br>The water began to boil, and Xifeng turned away bitterly to sea�son the prawns. She sliced the last of the ginger and scallions, hoping their client would be satisfied with the pink silk and pay immediately. They couldn&#x2019;t afford more vegetables until then, and eating plain rice&#x2014;something they&#x2019;d had to do many times in the past&#x2014;always put Guma in a fearsome temper.<br><br>Xifeng carried the meal into the front room. They ate in peace, inter�rupted only once by Guma criticizing how she had cooked the prawns, and then worked until the sun went down.<br><br>She recited poetry as she worked, something Guma always required her to do. Her aunt had drummed into her head that poetry, calligraphy, and music marked a well-born lady, and so she had endured many a sleepless night to study. She would have resented it, had it not proven that Guma wanted and <i>expected </i>a better life for her.<br> <i><br>The moon shines down upon us, beloved</i><br> <i>The water a vast and eternal mirror </i><br> <i>A voice whispers from every tender branch</i><br> <i>Turn your face from the world&#x2019;s apple-blossom fragility</i><br> <i>And embrace this boundless night</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Guma paused in the midst of stitching a plum blossom petal, her nostrils flaring. &#x201c;Where did you learn that?&#x201d; she demanded.<br><br>&#x201c;From one of your volumes.&#x201d; Xifeng gestured to a dusty stack of fad�ed texts in the corner, the meager remnants of her mother and aunt&#x2019;s school days. She often marveled at the wealth her grandparents had possessed, to have afforded such things for mere daughters.<br><br>&#x201c;Show it to me.&#x201d;<br><br>The tone of her aunt&#x2019;s voice made her put down the needle immedi�ately. Xifeng located the volume, one thinner and newer than the rest, and presented it to the older woman. Guma examined it, lips thinning as she ran her fingers over the unembellished back and turned it over to look at the title: <i>Poems of Love and Devotion.</i><br><br>She hastily shoved the book back at Xifeng, as though it had burned her fingers. &#x201c;Ning, isn&#x2019;t it time you went to bed?&#x201d;<br><br>Xifeng kept looking at her aunt as the girl put away her work and lit the red tallow candles. She hadn&#x2019;t realized the sun had set until she felt the candlelight relieve her strained eyes. As soon as Ning was gone, she asked, &#x201c;Did the poem remind you of something, Guma?&#x201d;<br><br>Her aunt spoke often about the past&#x2014;mostly to complain about the riches she had then that she didn&#x2019;t have now&#x2014;but rarely men�tioned her sister. All Xifeng knew of her mother was what she had been told only once: that Mingzhu had been beautiful and brainless and had gotten herself pregnant and abandoned by a nobleman. The pinched expression on Guma&#x2019;s face suggested she was thinking of her now, but when she spoke, it had nothing to do with her.<br><br>&#x201c;I know that poem. It was . . . told to me many years ago.&#x201d; She licked her dry lips, her gaze flickering from the text to her niece with some�thing like terror.<br><br>Xifeng had seen that fear twice in her life: once, when Guma had hobbled home in a frenzy to shut all of the doors and windows without explanation, and again after she had woken from a nightmare of spiral�ing black snakes.<br><br>There was a long silence.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to read the cards,&#x201d; Guma said.</p><h2>Psychological Science (Fifth Edition)</h2><p><p><strong>Reflecting the latest APA Guidelines and accompanied by an exciting, new, formative, adaptive online learning tool, <em>Psychological Science</em>, Fifth Edition, will train your students to be savvy, scientific thinkers.</strong></p><em>Psychological Science</em>, Fifth Edition, is a dynamic introduction to psychology that reflects the latest APA Guidelines.

Using superb details of lively pen drawings highlighted with gold leaf, the book features some of the most interesting selections from <i>Fior di Battaglia</i> (The Flower of Battle), a manuscript by the renowned Italian fencing master Fiore dei Liberi depicting the knightly arts of fighting with swords, daggers, and polearms, on foot and on horseback, and in and out of armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>The copy in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum, created in the early fifteenth century, is the finest and most complete manuscript to survive. Offering detailed visual documentation of Fiore&#x2019;s techniques coupled with the author&#x2019;s genius for explaining sophisticated methods of offense and defense, the manuscript provides a comprehensive record of the skills by which men lived and died in the Middle Ages. Included are an introductory commentary, brief explanations of positions and techniques, and fascinating details about medieval arms and armor.&nbsp;</p><p>Ken Mondschein is a Research Fellow and historical fencing instructor at the Higgins Armory Museum, teaches history at the American International College and Springfield College in Springfield, MA, and is a visiting fellow at the Center for Renaissance Studies at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

James Joyce's psychological novel vividly re-creates the sights, sounds, smells, and voices of a June day in 1904 within a structure loosely based on Homer's <i>Odyssey.</i> Famed for the stream-of-consciousness technique that marked the beginning of modernist literature, the tale abounds in parodies, riddles, and sparkling wordplay. The long shadow it casts over subsequent novels has raised the suggestion that English-language fiction since 1922 has been a series of footnotes to Joyce's masterpiece.<br>Few first editions generate more excitement among traders in rare books than <i>Ulysses</i>. Since the novel's debut, many experts have reinterpreted surviving drafts to produce revised texts, but this edition remains the one that Joyce himself reviewed and corrected prior to the initial publication. Thus, this volume represents the version truest to the author's vision.<br></p><p>Irish novelist, poet, and short-story writer James Joyce (1882&#x2013;1941) ranks among the giants of 20th-century literature.

Winner of two Nobel Prizes (for physics in 1903 and for chemistry in 1911), she performed pioneering studies with radium and contributed profoundly to the understanding of radioactivity. The history of her story-book marriage to Pierre Curie, of their refusal to patent their processes or otherwise profit from the commercial exploitation of radium, and her tragically ironic death are legendary and well known but are here revealed from an inside perspective. But, as this book reveals, it was also true. An astonishing mind and a remarkable life are here portrayed by Marie Curie's daughter in a classic and moving account.</p><p>Born in Paris on December 6, 1904, �ve Denise Curie Labouisse was graduated at Coll�ge S�vign� a Bachelor of Science and later as Bachelor of Science. �ve was the only member of her family who did not choose a career as a scientist and did not win a Nobel Prize. At the age of 16, she accompanied her mother, Mme. Curie, on a grand tour of the United States. After the death of her mother, Mile. Curie lived in a small apartment in Auteuil collecting and classifying the papers, manuscripts and personal documents left by Mme. Curie. Having decided to write the biography of her famous mother, she went to Poland in the August of 1935 to obtain all possible material on the youth of Mme. Curie. She brought back to France a quantity of letters photographs and other papers and at once began the composition of this book which has been published simultaneously in the United States, England, France Italy and Spain. Madame Curie was instantly popular; in many countries including the United States it was a bestseller. In the U.S. it won the third annual National Book Award for Non-Fiction voted by the American Booksellers Association. She was married but had no children. After her husband died, she lived the last years of her life in New York City where she died on October 22, 2007 at age 102. Her mother Marie Curie was born Maria Salomea Sk&#x142;odowska on 7 November 1867 in Warsaw Poland. Among the first discoveries of Marie Sk&#x142;odowska Curie was the discovery of the element Polonium, a chemical element with symbol Po and atomic number 84. It was discovered in 1898 by Marie and Pierre Curie, identified solely by its strong radioactivity: It was the first element to be so discovered. It was named after Marie Curie's homeland of Poland. Several other retroactive elements were discovered by her after the death of Pierre Curie. Named after her was the element Curium. This is a transuranic radioactive chemical element with symbol Cm and atomic number 96. She met Pierre Curie, married him and went on to her first achievements in science. A street accident killed Pierre and with her two children she carried her work forward alone. Because of her, the armament of medicine was to gain a new weapon. On 4 July 1934, she died at the Sancellemoz sanatorium in Passy, Haute-Savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation. Her work is now being carried on by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley California.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Algebra and Trigonometry with Analytic Geometry (with CengageNOW Printed Access Card) (Available Titles CengageNOW)</h2><p>Clear explanations, an uncluttered and appealing layout, and examples and exercises featuring a variety of real-life applications have made this text popular among students year after year.

Here he argues that, in the terror war, we are not facing a battle of the West against Islam&#x2015;a clash of civilizations. We are facing, instead, the same battle that tore apart Europe during most of the twentieth century, only in a new version. It is the clash of liberalism and its enemies&#x2015;the battle between freedom and totalitarianism that arose in Europe many years ago and spread to the Muslim world.<br><br> The author considers the wars against fascism and communism from the past, and draws cautionary lessons. But he also draws from those past experiences a liberal program for the present&#x2015;a program that departs in fundamental respects from the policies of the Bush administration.</p><p>Paul Berman writes about politics and literature for The New Republic, the New York Times Book Review, and other magazines. His books have been translated into thirteen languages. He lives in New York City.Berman puts his leftist credentials (he's a member of the editorial board of Dissent) on the line by critiquing the left while presenting a liberal rationale for the war on terror, joining a discourse that has been dominated by conservatives. The most original aspect of his analysis is to categorize Islamism as a totalitarian reaction against Western liberalism in a class with Nazism and communism; drawing on the ideas of Camus in The Rebel, Berman delineates how all three movements descended from utopian visions (in the case of Islamism, the restoration of a pure seventh-century Islam) into irrational cults of death. He illustrates this progression through a nuanced analysis of the writings of a leading Islamist thinker, Sayyid Qutb, ending with some chilling quotations from other Islamists, e.g., "History does not write its lines except with blood," the blood being that of Islam's martyrs (such as suicide bombers) as well as of their enemies, Zionists and Crusaders (i.e., Jews and Christians). Berman then launches into his most provocative chapter, and the one he will probably be most criticized for in politically correct journals: a scathing attack on leftist intellectuals, such as Noam Chomsky, who have applauded terrorism and tried to explain it as a rational response to oppression. Berman exhorts readers to accept that, on the contrary, Islamism is a "pathological mass political movement" that is "drunk on the idea of slaughter." A former MacArthur fellow and a contributing editor to the New Republic, Berman offers an argument that will be welcomed by disaffected progressives looking for a new analysis of today's world. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Production and Reproduction: A Comparative Study of the Domestic Domain (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology, Series Number 17)</h2><p>This book is an attempt to see the development of domestic institutions, the family, marriage, conjugal roles, in relation to changes in the mode of productive activity, and specifically with the change from hoe to plough agriculture. These differences are related to societies in Africa on the one hand, and in Asia and Europe on the other. The author tries to do this in two ways. He compares information derived from a range of human societies, historical as well as contemporary, employing the impressionistic techniques of the social scientist and comparative historian. But in addition, he has tried to make systematic use of material on a range of world societies, coded in the Ethnographic Atlas. In the main chapters of the book, the author examines general features of the network of traditional social roles found in these two continental areas of the Old World. He discusses the reasons why Europe and Asia should stress marriage within the social group, monogamous unions as well as the roles of concubine, step-parent, spinster and adopted child, whereas in Africa, the emphasis is on marriage outside the group, polygyny and co-wives. Similar differences emerge in a range of other features, including the division of labour by sex. Behind all these lie differences in the systems of agriculture and the nature of the social hierarchies which they support. Professor Goody is firmly committed to the idea that the social sciences have no alternative but to be comparative and explicitly historical if they are to contribute to the serious causal analysis of fundamental features of social organisation and development. His broad and ambitious book will appeal to anyone with a professional interest in social sciences - historians, anthropologists, sociologists, geographers and economists.</p><p>An ambitious general study of the development of marriage, family and conjugal roles in the change from hoe to plough agriculture, relating African society to Asian and European.</p><h2>The Drug of Art: Selected Poems</h2><p><p>&#x201c;The verses and fate of the poet Ivan Blatny . . . complete the fate of Czech literature, which transcended the borders of the nation, often struggling for survival.&#x201d;&#x2014;V�clav Havel</p><p>&nbsp;Lost to the world for twenty-five years, Ivan Blatny was, according to the Czech Ministry of Culture, &#x201c;one of the most significant Czech poets of the twentieth century.&#x201d; Blatny fled Czechoslovakia after the Communist coup in 1948, but didn&#x2019;t cope well with exile.

Assessment methods are integrated with instruction and presented according to when teachers evaluate students (before, during, and after an instructional unit), the learning targets that are measured, and standards emphasized in state-wide testing. There is considerable emphasis on the nature of learning targets and how different assessments are most appropriate for different targets. For each assessment technique, suggestions for effective practice are presented with examples, case studies, and teacher interviews.</p> <p> New to This Edition </p> <ul> <li>Shows through &#x201c;Teacher&#x2019;s Corner&#x201d; segments how actual teachers apply principles in their classrooms so that students can readily transfer lessons to actions </li><li>Provides expanded coverage of formative assessment and the concept of alignment of classroom assessments with large-scale assessments and standards to meet current classroom needs </li><li>Gives more comprehensive coverage of large-scale testing for accountability and the role of state standards in influencing classroom assessment </li><li>Emphasizes the difference between assessment of learning and assessment for learning to illustrate how assessment affects lessons and daily activity </li><li>Includes new and extensive treatment of the role of student motivation and the effect of feedback and praise on motivation </li><li>Has an Instructor&#x2019;s Manual/Test Bank with additional resources available online by contacting your local representative</li> </ul> <p>Package this text with&nbsp;MyEducationLab.

Biskind charts in fascinating detail the meteoric rise of the controversial Harvey Weinstein, often described as the last mogul, who created an Oscar factory that became the envy of the studios, while leaving a trail of carnage in his wake. He follows Sundance as it grew from a regional film festival to the premier showcase of independent film, succeeding almost despite the mercurial Redford, whose visionary plans were nearly thwarted by his own quixotic personality.<br> <br>Likewise, the directors who emerged from the independent movement, such as Quentin Tarantino, Steven Soderbergh, and David O. Russell, are now among the best-known directors in Hollywood. Not to mention the actors who emerged with them, like Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Ethan Hawke, and Uma Thurman.<br> <br>Candid, controversial, and &#x201c;sensationally entertaining&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>) <i>Down and Dirty Pictures</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in the film world.</p><p>You've heard the rumors. The film industry is filled with ruthless executives who think nothing of brow-beating their employees, of using creative accounting to cheat filmmakers, and re-cutting a director's vision into a soulless crowd-pleaser. Well, it turns out those rumors are often true--at least according to Peter Biskind's highly entertaining <i>Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film</i>. Packed with industry anecdotes and history, the book chronicles the growth and eventual mainstreaming of independent films and offers the back-story to seminal works including <i>sex, lies, and videotape</i> and <i>Pulp Fiction</i> among others. Biskind, author of <i>Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood</i>, divides most of his time between Sundance Film Festival founder Robert Redford and Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein. Biskind simultaneously credits these two as fostering, though ultimately ruining, the purity of indpendent film. Other indies are largely left out, although the now-defunct October Films appears prominently in the role of noble failure. Biskind has serious points to make, but he's not stingy with the war stories, either. (One particularly amusing scene involves October executives chasing Robert Duvall's agent through a Sheraton Hotel in an attempt to stop him from making a deal with Miramax to distribute <i>The Apostle</i>.) Those who have only a passing interest in the movie business may tire of Biskind's oft-repeated themes (Weinstein is an evil genius! Redford is a passive-aggressive control freak!) but for those who truly love film industry gossip, <i>Down and Dirty Pictures</i> is a feast of insider stories--each tidbit juicier than the last. <i>--Leah Weathersby</i><b>Peter Biskind</b> is the author of&nbsp;five previous books, including <i>Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'n' Roll Generation Saved Hollywood.</i> He is a contributor to <i>Vanity Fair</i> and was formerly the executive editor of <i>Premiere</i> magazine.

Now youngsters can experience this classic story in a whole new yucky way, by listening to it on audiocassette. Narrator Jay O. Sanders gives extra kick and vitality to this already lively yarn. He throws himself into the role of a 10-year-old boy, facing the most revolting bet of his life. Billy must eat 15 worms in 15 days--but the reward will be worth it: $50 for a shiny new minibike. Luckily, Billy's friends cook up these fat juicy grubs in a variety of appetizing ways--drenched in ketchup and mustard, fried in butter and cornmeal, and the pi�ce de r�sistance, a Whizband Worm Delight (an ice-cream worm cake). Sanders derives obvious pleasure from reading (and singing) out loud the hilarious rhymes and childish chants concocted from the mind of the book's author, Thomas Rockwell.<p> "Trout, Salmon, flounder, perch,<br> I'll ride my minibike into church.<br> Dace, tuna, haddock, trout,<br> Wait'll you hear the minister shout."</p><p> <i>How to Eat Fried Worms</i> is a ghastly gastronomical treat that will dazzle young listeners. (Running time: two hours, two cassettes) <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i></p>"Because of a bet, Billy is in the uncomfortable position of having to eat fifteen worms in fifteen days. A hilarious story that will revolt and delight bumptious, unreachable intermediate-grade boys and any other less particular mortals that read or listen to it....

So getting to edit (and read--at last!) the three books of the Galactic Milieu, which finally explain all those mysterious and tantalizing hints, was a real blast. They really do bring everything full circle, and I am more amazed than ever at a mind that could pull off such a thoroughly complex and rich cycle of stories.

Human colonies are thriving on numerous planets, life on Earth is peaceful and prosperous, and as more humans are being born with metapsychic abilities, it will not be long before these gifted minds at last achieve total Unity.<br><br>But xenophobia is deeply rooted in the human soul. A growing corps of rebels plots to keep the people of Earth forever separate, led by a man obsessed with human superiority: Marc Remillard.

It examines how these themes and modes apply to a variety of texts including film, soap operas, reality television, romance novels, and pornography. <br><br> The book introduces readers to pivotal film and media theory and explores gender and sexuality as contextual, rather than fixed. It focuses on how what is considered to be a biological given is also shaped by particular cultures at particular times, and how this is then reflected in popular culture. <br><br> The chapters address topics such as masculinity and looking, femininity, domesticity, and television, pornography and representation, and the romance novel as "pornography" for women. Students will also consider queer representations in Hollywood, slasher films, and the growing genre of fan fiction. <br><br> <i>Understanding Gender and Sexuality in Popular Culture</i> helps readers enjoy popular culture while developing a new way of "seeing" and critiquing it. The book is an excellent reader for courses on gender and visual culture, popular culture, and gender and sexuality studies. <br><br><b>Jennifer Maher</b> holds a Ph.D. in English and modern studies from the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.

Fort Osage, built on a Missouri River bluff 250 miles west of St. Louis, was officially opened on that date, and the Osage Indians signed a treaty with the Americans written by Governor Meriwether Lewis.</p><p>Fort Osage, intended as a citadel for the opening of the great American West, was also to function as a trading post for the Osage Nation. It was President Jefferson's hope that Fort Osage and other fort-trading posts would not only keep peace on the frontier but would also begin a new era in relations between Native Americans and the United States. For a short time, the fort did provide the Osage with a place to trade their furs. It also offered them limited protection from the many other tribes who were their enemies. However, the Osage chiefs discovered very quickly that the fort was small consolation for the lands they had given up by signing the treaty.</p><p>In this well-written and very readable work, Kristie C. Wolferman traces the history of the Osage Nation from its origins to its forced departure from Missouri. She demonstrates the ways in which the Osage culture changed with each new encounter of the Osage with Europeans. The Osage had already experienced many contacts with the white man before Fort Osage came to be. They had encountered French trader-trappers, explorers, missionaries, Spanish administrators, and early settlers. Their lives had been changed by the influx of white disease, by the use of European trade goods and weapons, and by the political control of Spanish, French, and American governments. As a result, the Fort Osage experiment came too late to establish lasting good relations between the white men and the Indians.</p><p><i>The Osage in Missouri</i> suggests that the white men could never understand the Osage way of life, nor the Osage the white men's way. But Osage culture, greatly altered by Europeans and Americans, would never be the same again. The Osage would be forced to sacrifice most of their traditions and beliefs, as well as their homeland, on the way to becoming "civilized."</p></p><p>In this well-written and very readable work, Kristie C.

Though Nuala is recovering from the stress of her demanding musical career and the birth of their second child, she still has the wherewithal to sense the evil intentions of past and present criminals.<p> Over 100 years after a mass murder occurred, Nuala and Dermot discover an old diary that chronicles the investigation of that murder and the trial and conviction of an innocent man. As they read about the young journalist Edward Fitzpatrick, they begin to uncover a story that still angers the local inhabitants. As a series of modern crimes occurs, Dermot and Nuala wonder if there is a connection between the past and the present.</p><p> That author Andrew M. Greeley has done his homework is evident in his careful reconstruction of a historical time period and a fact-based crime. The story line of Fitzpatrick and the past murders is by far the more interesting one, and readers may happily skip to these italicized sections without missing much about Dermot and Nuala. Good fiction has great conflicts, and the Fitzpatrick story line has enough to keep your interest. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p><p>Priest, sociologist, author and journalist, Father Andrew M.

It thematically and analytically discusses the emergence of India as one of the world&#39;s largest democracies and one of the most stable of the states to emerge from the experience of colonialism. The foundations of this rare phenomenon in either Asia or Africa are seen in India&#39;s society, the ideas and beliefs of her people, and the institutions of government and politics which have developed on the subcontinent, in a process of interaction between what was indigenous to India and the many external influences brought to bear on the country by economic, political, and ideological contact with the Western world. Modern scholarship has shown how diverse and complex was India&#39;s socio-economic and political development; and this theme runs through the study which eschews any simple understanding of India&#39;s political development as a clash between &#34;imperialism&#34; and &#34;nationalism&#34;, or the making of a new nation. The complexity reflects many of the continuing ambiguities and inequalities in the subcontinent&#39;s life and suggests why the structures of the state, and indeed the very nature of the Indian nation, are now being questioned, often with unprecedented public violence. India&#39;s dilemmas are not hers alone: they also raise economic, political, and social issues of profound significance throughout the contemporary world.</p><p>Judith Brown is the author of Winds of Change (OUP, 1991), and of Men and Gods in a Changing World: Some Themes in the Religious Experience of 20th-Century Hindus and Christians (1980).By far the best recent introductory account of the modern history of India * Times Higher Education Supplement *</p><h2>The Modern Researcher</h2><p>Widely used by professionals and students since its first appearance thirty-five years ago, The Modern Researcher is the classic introduction to the techniques of research and effective writing and speaking.

Soon after arriving in their new home, a large number of these immigrants, led by Father Charles Chiniquy, the charismatic Catholic priest who had brought them there, converted to Protestantism. In this anthropological history, Caroline B. Brettell explores how Father Chiniquy took on both the sacred and the secular authority of the Catholic Church to engineer the religious schism and how the legacy of this rift affected the lives of the immigrants and their descendants for generations. This intriguing study of a nineteenth-century migration of French Canadians to the American Midwest offers an innovative perspective on the immigrant experience in America.</p><p>Brettell chronicles how Chiniquy came to lead approximately one thousand French Canadian families to St. Anne, Illinois, in the early 1850s and how his conflict with the Catholic hierarchy over the ownership and administration of church property, delivery of the mass in French instead of Latin, and access to the Bible by laymen led to his excommunication. Drawing on the concept of social drama&#x2014;a situation of intensely lived conflict that emerges within social groups&#x2014;Brettell explains the religious schism in terms of larger ethnic and religious disagreements that were happening elsewhere in the United States and in Canada. Brettell also explores legal disputes, analyzes the reemergence of Catholicism in St. Anne in the first decade of the twentieth century, addresses the legacy of Chiniquy in both the United States and Quebec, and closely examines the French Canadian immigrant communities, focusing on the differences between the people who converted to Protestantism and those who remained Catholic.</p><p>Occurring when nativism was pervasive and the anti-immigrant Know-Nothing Party was at its height, Chiniquy&#x2019;s religious schism offers an opportunity to examine a range of important historical and anthropological issues, including immigration, ethnicity, and religion; changes in household and family structure; the ways social identities are constructed and reconstructed through time; and the significance of charismatic leadership in processes of social and religious change. Through its multidisciplinary approach, Brettell&#x2019;s enlightening study provides a pioneering assessment of larger national tensions and social processes, some of which are still evident in modern immigration to the United States.</p></p><p><p><b>Caroline B.

She is the author, coauthor, editor, or coeditor of fifteen books.</p>&#x201c;Full of insights and wonderful detail, this well-written book tells a fascinating story of an often forgotten figure in American immigration history. By focusing on the French Canadian religious leader Charles Chiniquy in the mid-nineteenth-century Midwest and using impressive skills in anthropology and history, Brettell brings fresh perspectives to the study of French Canadian migration as well as the analysis of broader theoretical issues of social conflict, identity formation, and charismatic leadership.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Nancy Foner,</b>&nbsp;coauthor of <i>Strangers No More: Immigration and the Challenges of Integration in North America and Western Europe</i><br><br> "With an extensive bibliography, endnotes, and a lengthy index, Brettell has made a worthwhile contribution to the ethnology of religious schism and its aftermaths and to the literature of Franco-American religion. I recommend the book to university libraries with a strong programme in North American religious history and immigration."&#x2014;<b>Paul Laverdure</b><br><br>"The first half of Brettell&#x2019;s study provides a fine-grained anatomy of the initial French Canadian migration to Illinois&#x2019;s Kankakee Valley, an understudied facet of immigration history, especially when compared to the more widely researched French Canadian immigrants in New England. The author also explores Chiniquy&#x2019;s pre-migration and post-migration career as both a Catholic priest and a Presbyterian minister, devoting ample space to analyses of Chiniquy&#x2019;s interactions, both positive and negative, with fellow immigrants and with allied and opposing religious leaders."--<b>William S.

For many people, these scenarios trigger ingrained assumptions about individuals&#x2019; beliefs, politics, aesthetics, values, and behaviors that leave little room for nuance and elaboration. This collection of essays explores local knowledge and aesthetic practices, often marked as &#x201c;folklore,&#x201d; as sources for creativity and meaning in Italian-American lives. As the contributors demonstrate, folklore provides contemporary scholars with occasions for observing<br>and interpreting behaviors and objects as part of lived experiences. Its study provides new ways of understanding how individuals and groups reproduce and contest identities and ideologies through expressive means.</p><p>Italian Folk offers an opportunity to reexamine and rethink what we know about Italian Americans. The contributors to this unique book discuss historic and contemporary cultural expressions and religious practices from various parts of the United States and Canada to examine how they operate at local, national, and transnational levels. The essays attest to people&#x2019;s ability and willingness to create and reproduce certain<br>cultural modes that connect them to social entities such as the family, the neighborhood, and the amorphous and fleeting communities that emerge in large-scale festivals and now on the Internet. Italian Americans abandon, reproduce, and/or revive various cultural elements in relationship to ever-shifting political, economic, and social conditions. The results are dynamic, hybrid cultural forms such as valtaro accordion music,<br>Sicilian oral poetry, a Columbus Day parade, and witchcraft (stregheria). </p><p>By taking a closer look and an ethnographic approach to expressive behavior, we see that Italian-American identity is far from being a linear path of assimilation from Italian immigrant to American of Italian descent but is instead fraught with conflict, negotiation, and creative solutions. Together, these essays illustrate how folklore is evoked in the continual process of identity revaluation and reformation.</p></p><p>Joseph Sciorra is Associate Director for Academic and Cultural Programs, John D. Calandra Italian American Institute, Queens College, CUNY. He is the editor of the Italian American Review, a bi-annual social science journal.The book is very pleasing and easy to read. Some essays, particularly those based on personal memoirs, are really moving and made me rethink in a more profound manner about deeply rooted behaviors. (<i>&#x2015;Maria Kaliambou, Western Folklore</i>)<br><br>Sciorra's book conveys a strong sense of urgency to reexamine and re-think what we know about Italian Americans, while contributing to the legitimization of Italian-American folklore. (<i>&#x2015;Modern Italy</i>)<br><br>It is rare to call a work of academic scholarship a page turner, but I think this collection is worthy of the honor. . . To put it bluntly, this collection is a joy to read.

Complex Contracting makes major contributions in this regard, both through providing an accessible conceptual framework for approaching challenging contract situations, as well as in illustrating how key principles in contracting operate in practice and over time as the respective parties work to achieve desired outcomes. The book is written brilliantly to engage both academics and practitioners in the thorny issues of risk, commitment, unforeseen contingencies and renegotiation, monitoring and management, incentives and more, while drawing out invaluable insights that can be applied broadly across a range of public sector contracting activities."

When it first appeared, Professor Dobb&#39;s detailed analysis of the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemical pursuits further stimulated interest in the subject by firmly establishing the importance of alchemy in Newton&#39;s thought. This book sets the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemy in their historical context in Restoration England. It is shown that alchemical modes of thought and particularly those of a Neoplatonic kind, were quite strong in many of those who provided the dynamism for the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century and that these modes of thought had important relationships with general movements for reform in the same period: reform of religion, philosophy, learning, society and of man himself. Newton&#39;s alchemy is thus seen as a critical link between Renaissance Hermeticism and the rational chemistry and mechanics of the eighteenth century.</p><p>This book sets the foundations of Newton&#39;s alchemy in their historical context in Restoration England.

His argument for a multidisciplinary approach (a "psychocultural biology") is supported by his reconsideration of the etiology of several well-known cases of attempted or completed suicide. Indeed, Kushner suggests that all investigations into the etiology of suicide could benefit from an eclectic viewpoint and that therapy should be more holistic. He also reassesses the role of the American frontier in deflecting cultural tensions and deferring individual compensatory needs.
